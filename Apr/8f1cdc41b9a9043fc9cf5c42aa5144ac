The Chronicle Business Reporter GOVERNMENT is creating a framework that will ensure increased focus on commercial activities at the country’s schools in line with the entrepreneurship and economic transformation drive. The matter came under discussion in Cabinet on Tuesday where the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education was mandated to provide equitable, quality, inclusive, relevant and competence-driven primary, secondary and non-formal education. “The ministry will promote commercial ventures in schools through utilisation of land and space available to schools. The public schools will engage in commercial activities through fostering joint ventures with private investors,” said Monica Mutsvangwa, Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services in a post Cabinet media briefing. “A business development unit will be established at the ministry’s head office to supervise, monitor and evaluate the implementation of the schools commercial venture project.” Following Cabinet engagement, Cde Mutsvangwa said the Ministry of Education’s deliverables encompass improving governance and access to quality, equitable and inclusive education as well as increasing uptake and application of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM). Other areas of focus entail improving research, development and innovation; vocational skills and entrepreneurship among the youth and citizens; and access to affordable quality education.
