FOOTBALL coaches in Bulawayo have welcomed plans put in motion for the resumption of lower-division leagues by the country’s four regions. The Eastern, Central, Northern and Southern regions, which oversee the Division One and Division Two leagues, met in Kwekwe on Saturday where they agreed to start games on June 12. Zimbabwe National Soccer Coaches Association (Zisca) Bulawayo province secretary Morris Mukwiti said steps being taken now are long overdue. “We are very excited about this development. In fact, it’s long overdue because players were now losing faith and becoming impatient. Football is an industry and sustains many families. It’s unfortunate that the Covid-19 pandemic destroyed many people’s lives which depend on playing and coaching football. “As Zisca, we welcome the return of football. However, we acknowledge that the return of lower-division football has its own challenges and coaches now have to work hard to revive football. Most players had given up and they are no longer physically and mentally fit to play competitive football,” said Mukwiti. Division One leagues in the regions have been tentatively set to start on June 12 and run until December. – @innocentskizoe
