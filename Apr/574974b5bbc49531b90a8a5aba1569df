THE Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (BUZ) is hunting for individuals to fill in coaching and managerial vacancies for various national teams. The union is seeking coaches for the senior women’s and men’s teams, Under-23 women and men, Under-18 boys as well as Under-16 boys and girls teams. Team managers for the same teams are also being sought. Applicants can send their CVs to BUZ before April 16. Buz recently missed out on the inaugural edition of the Basketball Africa League (BAL), opting to take its time before going for a proper crack at the premier African Club competition. The competition is a collaboration between the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) and makes its long-awaited start next month in Kigali, Rwanda. It will run from May 16-30 and will have an 18-game group phase, with 12 teams divided into three groups of four. Champions from the national leagues in Angola, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal and Tunisia earned their participation in the inaugural season. The remaining six teams, which come from Algeria, Cameroon, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique and Rwanda, secured their participation through BAL qualifying tournaments conducted by FIBA Regional Office Africa across the continent in late 2019. – @innocentskizoe
