The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent THERE is a new kid on the gospel chapters that the world should look out for as her music that is laden with gospel teachings will likely touch the souls of many. Using the stage name Matsho, Gugulethu Moyo scored a first last week as she led the Amaqhawanentaba FM Gospel Top 20 chart. Speaking from her Yeoville base in Johannesburg, the 33-year-old songstress said her aim is to preach the gospel through music all over the world. She said she ventured into music five years ago. “I started to record music professionally in 2016 and have managed to release two albums, Ngipheth’uJehovah (April 2017) and Akehluleki (September 2019). I’m now working on the next album. “It’s my prayer that God touches whoever listens to my music and changes their life situation,” said Matsho who is also a professional designer. – @mthabisi_mthire
