The Chronicle Zimbabwe look to bounce back after a gratifying white-ball series, while Pakistan eye an improved batting performance.
Overview: Zimbabwe v Pakistan Harare Sports Club April 29 – May 3 Zimbabwe have named a young squad for the two-match series against Pakistan with the inclusion of five uncapped players. Luke Jongwe, Richard Ngarava, Roy Kaia, Milton Shumba, and Tanaka Chivanga have all earned their maiden Test call-ups. Pakistan would look to make amends in the batting department as the margin of victory in the T20Is were threatening. But with momentum in their favour after a successful white-ball campaign, Pakistan will eye for improved all-round performance. Remember the last time. The last encounter between the two sides in the Test format was way back in 2013 on the same ground. Coming from behind in the two-Test series, Zimbabwe stayed patient to snatch a victory on the final day of the second Test match to square the series and share the trophy. Zimbabwe and Pakistan fought each other neck-to-neck as Misbah-ul-Haq stood in Zimbabwe’s way to the victory but as wickets fell from the other end, Misbah’s unbeaten resilience came to a natural end. Tendai Chatara starred with the ball as he took a five-for which led Zimbabwe to a 24-run win. What they said
Sean Williams (Zimbabwe Captain): “We are pretty excited for the tests. The wickets look extremely good for that and a new bunch of players will join the team and start their training.” Hasan Ali (Pakistan All-rounder): “We are looking forward to it. The last test series we played went well for both the team and myself. In the game, I took 10 wickets and we will definitely play better cricket.” – ICC Cricket
