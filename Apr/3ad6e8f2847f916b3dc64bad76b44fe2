The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent UP AND COMING gospel musician Innocent Elayi Banda popularly known as Innora has collaborated songstress Vuyo Brown on a gospel track meant to encourage masses to have faith in God regardless of hardships faced along the way. The single was released today and is available on a number of various digital platforms that include the artistes’ YouTube, SoundCloud and Audiomack accounts. Inspired by local gospel artiste Kirah and South Africa’s Benjamin Dube, the 23-year-old artiste said the song is all about putting ones trust on God. “The reason why I wrote this song is that if we look at this generation, things are very difficult, people have lost faith in God and others are doing things which are not good not because they want to but because of situations. “No matter what has happened to you in the past or what is going on in your life right now, it has no power to keep you from having an amazingly good future if you walk by faith in God. God loves us. He wants us to live with victory over sin so you can possess His promises for your life today,” said Innora. Innora who was born in Gwanda and later grew up in Bulawayo started his music career after his father gifted him with a computer and studio equipment as a 14th birthday present. In 2018, he released his debut album Uthando Lwakho which earned him praises and appreciation from the public and this followed his second album in 2019 titled Impilo Yami. In 2018, Innora was an opening act at the 6th Face OF KZN Model Search Contest which was held in Pietermaritzburg in South Africa. There he got an opportunity to share the stage with the all-time favourite S’phesihle Vazi (from Selimathunzi), Austin R. Mothabo (known as Noah from Skeem Saam) and Carla Van Reuburg. -@mthabisi_mthire
