COMEDY Tourism is what Umahlekisa Comedy Club will use to celebrate their eighth anniversary as they want to spread their craft across the country. Umahlekisa Comedy Club was formed some eight years ago and unfortunately, they could not hold celebrations last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This year they had to think outside the box and have come up with what they call Comedy Tourism. According to Umahlekisa director Ntando Van Moyo, Comedy Tourism will afford people the chance to go outside the city and get entertained during their visits to attractions. “We want to do a Comedy Tourism drive where people can go out of the city, visit places and have a day out. In the middle of the braaing, eating and sightseeing, there will be performances from comedians and other artistes. “Sometimes people go to these tourist attractions around the city just to braai. There will be nothing else to entertain them, so we thought of infusing these outings with our comedy,” said Van Moyo. As part of their anniversary celebrations on May 1, Umahlekisa will be holding an outing at Silwane Tours in Umguza. Dubbed Umahlekisa at 8 Getaway, the outing will have performances from Mandla Da Comedian, MsDee and Zwe fused with musicians such as Qeqe, Luchi Shiki alongside Mengezi the Magician. Van Moyo and Babongile Sikhonjwa will be the braai masters.
