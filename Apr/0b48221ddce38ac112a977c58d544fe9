The Chronicle Mashudu Netsianda and Leonard Ncube, Chronicle Reporters MOST churches cancelled their traditional Easter retreat with the religious organisations opting to live streaming their services to congregants. However, the few that conducted physical services conformed to the lockdown regulations with gatherings not exceeding 50 congregants. In some cases, police moved around monitoring churches to ensure compliance. Easter, also called Pascha (Greek, Latin) or Resurrection Sunday, is a festival and holiday when Christians will be commemorating the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. Under the relaxed lockdown regulations, gatherings at funerals are still restricted to 30 people with other public gatherings not supposed to exceed 50 people. Churches are allowed to congregate only if there are 50 or less members in attendance and exercise personal hygiene coupled with wearing face masks. <img class="alignnone wp-image-539230 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Churches-Easter-3.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="354" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Churches-Easter-3.jpeg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Churches-Easter-3-360x187.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chronicle news crew today visited selected churches in Bulawayo and Victoria Falls and observed the most of the church buildings were under lock and key.
