The Chronicle Chippa United have withdrawn the appointment of Luc Eymael. The controversial coach was announced as the Chilli Boy’s technical adviser after the team announced they had parted way with coach Dan Malesela after a 5-1 league loss to Maritzburg United on Saturday. Eymael’s return to country has not sat well with most. There are allegations of racism involving the former Free State Stars coach while coaching in Tanzania last year. Safa issued a statement with an intent to ban him for the alleged comments. The Gqeberha side released a statement which said the decision to withdraw the appointment of Eymael, was not based on any concrete evidence or legal position regarding the claims against him, but was rather informed by the club’s sensitivity to the gravity of the accusations against Eymael, the public outcry and to also allow the matter to be fully investigated. — iol
