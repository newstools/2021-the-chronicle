The Chronicle JOSE MOURINHO was axed as Tottenham boss after a players’ revolt. The Special One’s 17-month reign in charge at Spurs came to an end when he was sacked this morning — just six days before they face Manchester City in the Carabao Cup Final at Wembley. But while it was Daniel Levy who did the firing, it was the club’s playing stars who supplied the bullets after several of them went to see their chairman to complain about the Special One’s tactics and methods, which had raised an increasing number of eyebrows in their dressing room in recent weeks. Senior squad members had bitten their lips after becoming accustomed to the way Mourinho treated and ignored those not in his plans with absolute contempt. But they could stay silent no longer when he tried to throw them under the bus and blame them for Tottenham’s failure to win the Europa League and close in on a top-four finish. <img class="alignnone wp-image-542042 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/spurs1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/spurs1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/spurs1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> And when first-team regulars who had previously been “Mourinho loyalists” started to voice their concerns, Levy simply had to act. There were too many unhappy faces on the training ground which Levy patrols daily. They are believed to have included skipper Hugo Lloris and striker Harry Kane. Both of whom had been staunchly behind Mourinho, but even the France and England captains are believed to have become concerned by Mourinho’s actions. After the 58-year-old’s exit was confirmed, Kane tweeted: “Thank you for everything Boss. A pleasure to have worked together. I wish you all the best for your next chapter.” Under previous boss Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham’s training Enfield HQ had become a place where all members of staff, including execs, cleaners and multi-million pound football celebrities greeted each other with a handshake and a “Good morning.” Now it was threatening to become an environment where players and colleagues could not even look each other in the eyes. — BBC Sport
