Motorcyclists under the Zimbabwe Free Riders Club (ZFRC) on Saturday donated an assortment of goods to Precious Souls Children’s Home in Redcliff as part of their charity work. The bikers who rode from Harare to the Midlands mining town, handed over goods including mattresses, food items and cutlery to the home which is under construction. The riders later toured the town as part of their efforts to encourage more people to take up motorcycling. ZFRC Programs Coordinator, Chelsea Nherera said the club had taken it upon itself to ride for a cause. “Mostly biking is for fun but we decided to find a cause and decided to come up with annual events where we can do something meaningful. We wanted fun with a cause so decided to make this donation to Precious Souls Children’s Home today,” said Nherera. She said the donations were mobilised by the bikers. “Today we handed over about 30 mattresses, sugar beans, stationery, food items and cash for paying of tuition fees all valued at US$1 400. These were contributions made by our members and we look forward to doing this almost every year,’’ she said. <img class="wp-image-540735 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Bikers-invade-Rutendo-Shopping-Centre.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Bikers-invade-Rutendo-Shopping-Centre.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Bikers-invade-Rutendo-Shopping-Centre-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bikers invade Rutendo Shopping Centre Nherera said every year they also go on a campaign trail where they try and educate people on the advantages of riding bikes. “You know bikes are a cheap mode of transport, so every year when we make a donation, we also go on a campaign where we try to encourage more people to take up motorcycling. We are also targeting the rural folk and the females to take up riding as we also do it for a cause not only for fun,” she said. The bikers caused a stir when they went on a tour of the town making stopovers for photoshoots and showcasing their bikes. Precious Souls co-founder and chairperson, Medinah Ramjee said the donation could not have come at a better time. “This came at a time when we are about to complete the first of the four buildings earmarked for construction at this site. We are grateful to the bikers for thinking of a worthy cause like this,” said Ramjee. She said the orphanage was home to 24 children. “We registered in 2017 and we are grateful to Redcliff Municipality who donated a piece of land where we are now constructing these buildings. We started the construction for the building in November 2020 and with the help of the community and local businesspeople, we are now almost complete. We are home to 24 children and we are so grateful to the bikers,” she said. The bikers’ club was formed in 2015 and since 2018, the motorcyclists have been embarking on a journey from Harare to one of the world’s most sought-after tourist destinations, Victoria Falls where they would make donations to Chinotimba orphanage, but due to Covid-19 travel restrictions, they decided to visit other smaller towns.
