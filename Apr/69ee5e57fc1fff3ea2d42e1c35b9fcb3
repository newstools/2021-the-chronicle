The Chronicle witnessed Dube’s employees, who appeared to be in a hurry to move the vehicles to an unknown destination, looking over their shoulders like they were expecting some people to come and stop them. One of the employees said they had received information from someone in Harare for them to move the vehicles. “We were asked to move the vehicles to a safer location. That’s all I can say. About what kind of a person Dube was or is, that I cannot tell you because we don’t know each other. So, if you may excuse us, we have a job to do,” said one of the employees. Police are appealing to members of the public that might have information leading to the arrest of Dube (35) who is on the run after allegedly shooting and killing his second wife’s alleged lover, Mr Shelton Chinhango, also a car dealer based in Kwekwe and Ms Gamuchirai Mudungwe (30).  He also allegedly shot and injured his second wife, Ms Nyasha Nharingo (31) and her sister Ms Nyaradzo (34). Nyaradzo’s 16-year-old daughter, who witnessed the horrific incident said she and her cousin, a toddler, who is Dube’s son with Nyasha, survived death by a whisker after he attempted to fire the gun at them only to be refrained by Ms Mudungwe. Dube allegedly committed the ruthless crime as his first wife watched in horror.
