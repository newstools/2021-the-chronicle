The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter GOLD producer, Caledonia Mining Corporation, has increased its quarterly dividend by nine percent to US$0,12 on each of the company’s shares. The mining concern, which owns Blanket Mine in Matabeleland South province, in January this year paid a previous quarterly dividend of US$0,11 per share. “The company is pleased to announce that the board of directors has declared an increased quarterly dividend of US$0,12 on each of the company’s shares,” it said. The upgraded dividend would be paid on 31 April 2021. <img class="alignnone wp-image-539679 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/TOWER1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/TOWER1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/TOWER1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Group chief executive officer, Mr Steve Curtis, was quoted as saying the latest quarterly dividend increase was the fifth in the past 18 months. “This represents a cumulative 75 percent rise in the dividend since the first increase in October 2019,” he said. Mr Curtis said the decision by the board to increase the dividend reflects Caledonia’s continued confidence in the outlook for its business. Last year, Caledonia’s total annual haul hit close to 58 000 ounces. The record haul came at a time when the Government was pushing for a mining production ramp up that is poised to see the country’s total mineral exports earning US$12 billion from 2023 onwards up from US$2,7 billion in 2017. -@okazunga
