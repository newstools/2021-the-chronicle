We are currently digging to expose the failed cable and we should reach there this afternoon, this will show us the extent of the damage,’’ said Eng Jaji Eng Jaji said they are hoping to repair the damage by midday tomorrow, and in the meantime, they have transferred clients to alternative feeds that are overloading and tripping. ‘‘Hopefully our technicians will be able to repair the damage by midday tomorrow latest. In the meantime, we have transferred clients to alternative feeds that are at times overloading and tripping,’’ he said. He apologised for the interruption of the power supply in the affected areas. ‘‘We are striving to restore power as soon as possible and we sincerely regret the inconvenience caused,’’ said Eng Jaji.

The power outage affected business operators in the city centre.
