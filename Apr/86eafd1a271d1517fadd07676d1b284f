VETERAN tennis coach Khumbulani Tembo says he will use his appointment as a committee member of the Bulawayo Metropolitan Tennis Board (BMTB) to push for the revival and development of the game in the city, particularly in the western suburbs. Tembo is the administrator of Tomasik Tennis Academy based at Emakhandeni Tennis Club and focuses on the development of young talent from the suburb and surrounding areas. It caters for players from the age of six, with the aim of nurturing them into professionals. Tembo has coached players such as Nicole Kumwenda, Hillary Ncube and Bukale Mukombwe, who all secured tennis scholarships to the United States of America. “It is an honour to serve the game that I love and I am pleased that l have been trusted with this task. My dream is to see the development of tennis in Bulawayo. From now on the work to improve the standards of the game in the city begins,” said Tembo. Other members of the BMTB executive that Tembo serves with are chairman Tarwirwa Chikunichiwa, Thesly Mufunda (vice-chairman), Alice Masoha (secretary-general), Chaps Manyowa (treasurer) and committee members Witness Jiyane, Zebediah Mawisire, Petros Ndhlovu and Johanne Marufu. They were ushered into office a fortnight ago in an election marred by controversy following allegations of ineligible individuals being allowed to vote. However, Tennis Zimbabwe (TZ) president Biggie Magarira said board member Gloria Gijima, who observed the elections, had not reported irregularities. According to the 2021 TZ calendar, Bulawayo is scheduled to host the Bulawayo Juniors Open, the Tarryn-Leigh De Souza Memorial and Bulawayo Closed tournaments. The province will also play host to the International Tennis Federation Under-18 tournaments in May. – @innocentskizoe
