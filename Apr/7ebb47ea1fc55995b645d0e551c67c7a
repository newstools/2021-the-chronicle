The Chronicle Showbiz Correspondents
HUNDREDS of disadvantaged children from Bulawayo’s Nkulumane suburb had a memorable Independence Day as they were treated to free hotdogs and drinks from steakhouse, Smokehouse. What started out as an April Fool’s Day prank by Chronicle Showbiz team led to this initiative that brought smiles to more than 500 children among them, those living with disabilities and the vulnerable from child-headed families. Commenting after the outing at Nkulumane Hall on Sunday, Smokehouse general manager, Tafadzwa Machirori said it was a great experience being in a child-conducive environment and seeing the smiles on the kids’ faces as they received their meals. “It was heart-warming to be able to add some cheer to the disadvantaged community of Nkulumane. We managed to feed more than 550 children from our target of 500 which was quite great,” said Machirori. Ward 22 councillor, Rodney Jele who was also part of the initiative said: “We had planned to feed 500 children and we ended up feeding more than 550. We had targeted some orphans from the ward and the churches assisted in identifying the children. “We also invited disabled children from the community and each child went away with a hot dog and a soft drink,” said Clr Jele.
