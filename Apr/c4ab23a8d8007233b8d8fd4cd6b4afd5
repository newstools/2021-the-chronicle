The Chronicle Business Reporter AT least 85 000 hectares of land would be put under winter wheat this year as the country seeks to boost output and meet local industry requirements. In an update on its official Twitter account today, the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement said preparations for this year’s winter cropping season are under way and will be rolled out in three programmes. “The Government is targeting 85 000 hectares of winter wheat this year under three programmes as follows; 60 000ha under Command Agriculture, 15 000ha under private investors and 10 000ha under Presidential Inputs Scheme,” said the ministry. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has already announced an additional $2.5 billion to capacitate farmers in the forthcoming 2021 winter wheat planting season. The increase in support for winter farmers is part of measures by the Government to boost output and curb imports. Annual wheat consumption for Zimbabwe is estimated at above 400 000 tons and yet wheat imports of around 80 percent are made each year. Following the good 2020/21 rain season, there is a need to vigorously scale up wheat production with the Government and the private sector both expressing commitment to work together in boosting output.
