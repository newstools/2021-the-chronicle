SOUTH AFRICA-based philanthropist Charity Sizani Tshuma says she wants to improve the standards of sport in Mangwe district, Matabeleland South. The state of football and netball in the district has been in shambles over the years, as there are no teams competing in respective domestic leagues. The youths in the district were dealt a major blow when sport was suspended last year, as it meant no more competitions for them. Tshuma has been sponsoring netball and football tournaments in the district as part of her efforts to empower the youths in the community. She recently launched the Mangwe Cluster One Sports organisation aimed at empowering young people and helping bring about success and entertainment. Tshuma says her organisation’s goal is to build young people in an atmosphere of love, liberty, learning and excellence. As a child of Mangwe, Tshuma desires nothing more than to uplift her community. “All the work that I have done for the community is to give back to the community that raised me. I intend to have more tournaments this year when all is cleared in order to identify and grow aspiring sportspeople. “Apart from assisting in sports, I have also helped with community projects and donated to numerous churches in the community,” said Tshuma. She said as a woman with a beauty school in the neighbouring country, Mangako Health and Beauty Academy, her ambition is to empower the rural girl child. “With netball, what I basically do is, I take the best performing girls during the tournaments that we have and give them scholarship vouchers worth R7  000 per student. After they graduate, I also look for suitable jobs for them. “At the moment we are looking forward to having a camp with girls from surrounding communities in Mangwe. We want to have a week-long camp where we will teach them sports and even other entrepreneurial channels,” said Tshuma.
