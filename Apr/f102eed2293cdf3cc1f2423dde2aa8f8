THE Pakistan cricket team is expected to arrive in Harare on Saturday ahead of their tour of Zimbabwe for two Test matches and three Twenty20 international (T20I) games at Harare Sports Club. The visitors are in South Africa for a limited overs series that concludes on Friday. First up are the T20I series, which begin on Wednesday next week then on April 23 and 25. The first Test match is scheduled to run from April 29 to May 3, with the second set for May 7-11. As part of measures to minimise the spread of Covid-19, the series will be held in a bio-secure bubble, which simply refers to an environment that is aimed at keeping the teams relatively isolated from the outside world. As a result, only those directly involved in the tour, that is the players, technical staffers, match officials and those offering the necessary support services, are the only people who will be permitted access to the stadium and the hotel accommodating the teams. This will see both Zimbabwe and Pakistan players and support staff undergoing several Covid-19 tests during the tour. â€“ @innocentskizoe
