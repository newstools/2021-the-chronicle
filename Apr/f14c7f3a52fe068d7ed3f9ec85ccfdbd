He said the total number of special needs candidates who sat for the November 2020 A-level examinations was 37 down from 55 the previous year. “The November 2020 examination candidates were in four different categories namely Enlarged Print, Braille, Hard of Hearing and Physical Impairment,” said Prof Mwenje. He applauded learners’ performance saying it was good despite the fact that learners barely attended school due to Covid-19-induced lockdown. “It is important to acknowledge that the 2020 candidates wrote the examinations under unprecedented conditions that were induced by the Covid-19 pandemic yet their performance though lower than that of 2019 is commendable,” said Prof Mwenje. He said the delays in the writing, marking, publication of the results resulted from mitigatory measures that were put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
