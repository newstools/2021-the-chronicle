TWO Bulawayo men allegedly raided a tuck shop armed with a machete, threatened to kill a woman before stealing property worth more than US$600. Prosper Moyo (24) of Mahatshula suburb and Obvious Meluswa, his accomplice who is still on the run, allegedly stormed a tuck shop in Kensington. Moyo approached the tuck shop owner Sinothando Dube (32) under the guise of a customer intending to buy groceries. Meluswa broke into the tuck shop using a back door while holding a machete. He demanded cash before hitting the woman with a machete on the face, to induce fear. The duo ransacked the tuck shop and Moyo stole US$500 while Meluswa took groceries worth US$50. The suspects also stole two mobile cell phones, a Hurricane phone (gold in colour) and a Samsung Galaxy Pocket handset. They locked Ms Dube inside the tuck shop and fled. Ms Dube managed to escape and screamed for help but nobody reacted.-@waydenaido.
