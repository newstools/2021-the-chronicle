THE Easter Holiday accident death toll increased by 225 percent compared to the same period last year. Eight people were killed last year and 26 died this year. In a statement yesterday, national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said 231 road accidents were recorded during the Easter Holiday this year compared to 178 that were recorded last year. He said 26 people died this year compared to eight last year while 149 people were injured compared to 22 in 2020. Asst Comm Nyathi said human error remains the major cause of the road accidents in the country. “The major causes of fatal road traffic accidents have been observed to be speeding, inattention, misjudgement, overtaking errors and failure to observe road rules and regulations which can all be attributed to human error,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. “We urge drivers to travel at safe speeds, considering the condition of the roads and safety of other road users. Pedestrians are also being urged to be observant when crossing any road and should check either side of the roads to ensure it is safe to cross before doing so. Motorists should be patient, considerate and observant on approaching roads under construction or repair.” He said public service vehicles have to follow Government’s Covid-19 health protocols. “The police therefore warn public service vehicle operators who are conducting inter-city movements and not complying with Covid-19 regulations by carrying passengers exceeding the 50 percent threshold allowed, with some carrying standing passengers, that the law will be applied to the bus crews/operators,” he said. Asst Comm Nyathi said cops will continue to impound pirating vehicles as they are violating the law. — @nqotshili
