The Chronicle Business Reporter THE Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development, Felix Mhona, has stressed the need to utilise locally sourced raw materials when undertaking various development projects in the country. Guided by the National Development Strategy (NDS1 2021-2025), the Government is on a massive drive to revamp key infrastructure such as roads, public service facilities and industrial development that promotes attainment of an upper middle-income economy by 2030. “Using local resources for local development is the way to go. Yesterday I toured Bitumen World Quarry Station in Mwenezi. They are producing quarry stones for the construction of the Harare-Beitbridge Highway and their production capacity is 160 tonnes per hour,” said Minister Mhona in a post on his official Twitter account.  About 200km of the Harare-Beitbridge Highway upgrade has been completed and the Government expects to have completed another 200km this year, making it a total of 400km in two years. “This is funded by our own resources without incurring debt. Brick by brick this country is leapfrogging towards #Vision2030,” said Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Mr Nick Mangwana, said.
