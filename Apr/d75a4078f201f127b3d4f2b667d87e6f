ZIMBABWE senior national cricket team all-rounder Sikandar Raza has confirmed that he had successful surgery on his right arm. Raza, who was part of the last tour against Afghanistan in the United Arab Emirates, underwent biopsy on his right arm last Friday. “The surgery went well and the sample of the bone has been sent to the lab for more testing that requires 10 days. I urge everyone again to keep me in your prayers and thank all of you for continuous prayers and love,” said Raza. This leaves Raza a doubt for the incoming tour by Pakistan. Zimbabwe will play Pakistan in two Test matches as well as well three Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) at Harare Sports Club this month and next month behind closed doors. The T20I series is scheduled for the 21st, 23rd and 25th of this month, while the first Test matches will be contested from April 29 to May 3 May and the second Test is scheduled for May 7-11 May. Pakistan are expected to arrive in Zimbabwe on the 17th of this month after their current tour of South Africa for three one-day internationals and the same number of T20Is. – @innocentskizoe
