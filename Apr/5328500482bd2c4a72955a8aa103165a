The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter WATER levels at Kariba Dam have continued to improve steadily rising by 1,21 meters to 481,97 meters, a development that maintains Zimbabwe’s potential to generate more electricity at Kariba Hydropower Station. Water levels at Kariba have of late been rising because of the good rains received in the 2020/2021 rain season. In a latest update, the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA) whose mandate is to oversee the operation and maintenance of Kariba Dam Complex, said the lake levels at Kariba have continued rising steadily due to increased inflows into Lake Kariba coming in from the Kariba upper and lower catchment. “From the last update provided on 3rd March 2021, the lake levels increased by a total of 1,21 metres, increasing from the level of 480,76m recorded on 3rd March 2021 and with an associated live storage of 24,30 BCM, to a lake level of 481,97 metres with a live storage of 30,30 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM) recorded on 7th April 2021. “This represents a 25 percent increase in live storage (usable water) over a period of 37 days,” said the authority. Despite the latest rise in water levels, ZRA said it has maintained the 30 BCM of water allocated for power generation operations at Kariba for 2021, sufficient to produce an average 800MW to be shared equally between Zimbabwe and Zambia. “A review of the hydrological outlook is scheduled to be undertaken by the end of the second quarter of 2021 that will inform on any adjustments to this water allocation,” it said. At 481,97 meters, the authority said this has placed the lake level at 6,47 metres above the Minimum Operating Level (MOL) of 475,50m. This places the lake water levels at 6,53 meters below the full supply level of 488,50 meters. -@okazunga
