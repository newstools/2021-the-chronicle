MONTROSE High School Upper Six student, Sherylin “Stizza” Sibanda has ventured into music and successfully released her debut single titled Umngae. The single that was released last week talks about marriages and friendships. The 18-year-old is multi-talented as she is a singer, songwriter, dancer, actress and aspiring choreographer who is inspired by the likes of South Africa’s Kamo Mpela and Babes Wodumo. Stizza as the up-and-coming artiste is referred to by her fans, said her new single is her first professional work to be released officially although she has two more songs which she recorded last year. “I now have three songs – that include Mama ka Stizza, Syadura, and the latest, Umngae that features Black Sheep. The latter is the first one to be released to the general public. “The song Umngae is there to warn people out there not to trust anyone in their marriages. They mustn’t let their friends be too close to their husbands because these are the same people who destroy people’s marriages. The song also advises men against cheating and disrespecting their wives,” said Stizza. The artiste who has shared the stage with the talented youngster, Tebza, said not attending class for the better part of last year influenced her to take up music as a professional career. She said she decided to join an arts organisation called Yellow World to nurture her arts talent. “I started my music career in 2020, recording with Candy Ice Records. So far, I have performed with a couple of award-winning artists like Tebza. I have also been part of music videos and youth initiatives like the Key to the City festival hosted by Yellow World. “I am also part of a production house called Yonny Productions where I showcase my acting skills,” said Stizza.-@mthabisi_mthire
