He said Mazhindu was a straight forward worker who was always reliable, adding that the company had lost a person who contributed immensely towards the selling of Zimpapers products. “we were shocked to receive the news of his passing on yesterday and as a company we are still finding it difficult to come to terms with the loss. Mazhindu was one of those people whom I have known to be honest and dedicated to his duties. In him the company lost an honest worker. May his soul rest in eternal peace,” said Mr Sibanda Fellow vendors who spoke to the news crew expressed shock. “He sold newspapers at corner 6th Avenue and Robert Mugabe Way. He was always jovial. I can’t think of a reason why someone would want to kill him. I know he had two grown up children,” said a vendor who declined to be named. A sister to the owner of the house where Farai used to stay Mrs Annah Jongondi said she could not think of a motive for the gruesome killing. “Rasta was just a person I knew as peaceful. He was a newspaper vendor for the Chronicle and a caretaker here at my brother’s house who is in the United States of America. We never had a problem with him. That is the reason why I was shocked to learn of the news of his death this morning,” she said. Bulawayo Provincial Police Spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube yesterday said police were yet to make arrests. <img class="wp-image-523287 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/abeddd.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/abeddd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/abeddd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Abednico Ncube He said: “On Wednesday at around 7 am, the informant was at her place of residence when she was told by a group of school children that an unknown male adult was lying in a pool of blood on the grass opposite her place of residence.
