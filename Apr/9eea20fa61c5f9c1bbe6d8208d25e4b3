Mutizwa was one of seven Zimbabwean players that were in action on Wednesday, with the others being the SuperSport quartet of goalkeeper George Chigova, who was making his debut, defender Onismor Bhasera, midfielder Kuda Mahachi and striker Evans Rusike. The other Zimbabweans who were in action are Mutizwa’s teammates Divine Lunga and Danny Phiri.
