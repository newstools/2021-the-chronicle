The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Fast-rising gospel musician, Themby Blossoms (real name Thembelani Nkiwane) has penned a song that is a prophecy declaration to Zimbabwe being one of the greatest countries once again. Titled Shall Be Greater, the single which has been released is Themby Blossoms fourth single. South Africa-based Themby Blossoms said the song that comes at a time the nation is celebrating its independence, gives hope of a Zimbabwe whose future is filled with success. “Shall Be Greater is already playing on different radio stations in Zimbabwe and South Africa. This is a prophetic declaration for our nation, Zimbabwe. It gives hope to all that we believe in God and that one day, we will have jobs, money and joy as the flag of Zimbabwe will rise again,” said Themby Blossoms. Popularly known as uNakamacakes because of her cake making business that she used to run in Bulawayo before relocating to South Africa, the artiste said she ventured into music two years ago. “I used to sell cakes a lot in Bulawayo from 2016 to 2019 before I moved to South Africa where I’m based now. I started recording in 2019 and released a testimony song titled Nyasha DzaJehovha. On this track, I thanked God for what he had done for me as I grew up an orphan after being rejected by my family. “But, by His grace, I managed to rise with the help of friends and prayer partners. From there, I released my second song titled Nyasha followed by Ndichamunamata.” – @mthabisi_mthire
