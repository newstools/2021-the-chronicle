Artistes in Bulawayo will be vaccinated against Covid-19 today at the Cowdray Park Clinic with the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) spearheading the process. The Chinese made Sinovac jab will be administered to artistes as from 10AM as the sector joins Zimbabweans in taking the vaccine. Last week in Harare, more than 30 artistes were inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine including NACZ executive director Nicholas Moyo. Moyo said he is attending today’s event and urged artistes to come and get the jab. “The idea is to push the statement that we are part of the society and we want to be vaccinated because it’s the right thing to do. This is to encourage the generality of the people to get vaccinated,” said Moyo. He said the NAMA @40 legends who live in Bulawayo will be vaccinated during the exercise today. “This vaccination is our commitment to creating safe working spaces for artistes,” said Moyo. He said they will also roll out the vaccination exercise to artistes in other parts of the country soon. “There are many artistes who have been vaccinating quietly and this is a good sign. We are going to engage our provincial managers to see how best the vaccination can be done in the provinces,” said Moyo. Since the Covid-19 outbreak in March last year, physical gatherings for live concerts have remained banned as part of a raft of measures to curb the spread of the deadly virus and as a result most artists are struggling to survive.
