The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Chronicle Correspondent A TEENAGER has been arrested after he allegedly raped a six-year-old girl who was walking from school, with a friend. Both the suspect and victim cannot be named because they are minors. Matabeleland South police provincial spokesperson Inspector Loveness Mangena confirmed the incident. “I can confirm that we have made an arrest of a 17-year-old boy from Sun Yet Sen village who on March 29 way laid and raped a six-year-old girl,” said Insp Mangena. She said the victim’s friend escaped and advised her friend’s mother. Insp Mangena said parents must accompany children, especially minors, to school to protect them from abuse. “We are always telling parents to accompany children to and from school so they do not fall victim to abuse. This is something that is painful for any parent and as police we feel the pain that comes with such cases,” said Insp Mangena. Alternatively, she said, parents must teach their children to move in groups and also encourage the children not to accept gifts and lifts from strangers. “Parents should also avoid leaving children in the custody of the opposite sex,” said Insp Mangena. @mthabisi_mthire
