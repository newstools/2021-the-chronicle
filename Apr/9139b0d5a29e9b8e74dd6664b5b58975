The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Gwanda Correspondent POLICE in Gwanda, Matabeleland South province have launched an operation code named “Operation uyibottle store na?” which seeks to close down nightclubs that are flouting the lockdown regulations. This comes after some nightclubs re-opened in violation of lockdown regulations. Most of the nightclubs have taken advantage of Cabinet’s relaxation of Covid-19 lockdown regulations allowing restaurants sit-in customers to re-open. Some of the nightclubs are open until the wee hours of the morning. Matabeleland South police provincial spokesperson Inspector Loveness Mangena said: “We launched the “Operation uyibottle store na?” on 27 March and since then up to today (yesterday) we have arrested six nightclubs operating in defiance of the lockdown regulations. “These are Manzamnyama night club, Village bar, Ultra-Light Bar, View ward bar, Phoenix Pub and Grill and Limelight Talk of Gwanda,” said Insp Mangena. Insp Mangena said the nabbed nightclub operators paid a fine of RTGS$500 each and if they commit the offence for the third time they will be dragged to the courts. She called on nightclub operators to comply with the lockdown regulations. “We are calling on nightclub operators to comply with lockdown regulations as time will come where they will open if the measures are relaxed. “There should be no sit-in at any bottle store and as police we will be out in full force to ensure that all this adhered to,” said Insp Mangena. Chronicle observed that a number of bottle stores and nightclubs in town continue to be defiant as they serve sit in customers. Bar operators from the western suburbs were selling their products illegally using the back doors. @mthabisi_mthire
