THE Bulawayo Volleyball Association (BVA) has begun consulting clubs in its quest alto come up with a proper framework for the resumption of the game. BVA chairperson William Mazviro says the association hopes to start playing games by the end of next month. “We held our executive meeting last week and decided to set a committee that will consult clubs and look into the feasibility of starting games. We are expecting something by the end of May. Hopefully by then we will be able to start our games,” Mazviro said. The association admitted that it faces a huge financial challenge to resume games. However, that has not deterred the association from working around means to ensure players get back onto the court. Hurricanes, Nust, Bulawayo Poly, Luveve High, Spartans and ZRP Raiders are some of the BVA league teams. At national level, Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) is also putting in place required protocols for a return of the national league. – @innocentskizoe
