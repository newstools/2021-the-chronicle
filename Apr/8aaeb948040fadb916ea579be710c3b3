A LOCAL lodge, Cycad, has completed a refurbishment and expansion project at a cost of US$150 000. The lodge, which is located in the upmarket suburb of Morningside in Bulawayo, had been under refurbishment and expansion in recent months. One of the directors, Mr Nyararai Gomba, said the upgrade exercise has increased room capacity to nine from two when the facility was opened a few years ago. “We started with two rooms, and now we have nine rooms in total. We have also renovated our conference room and pool as we sought to provide comfortable hospitality in Bulawayo especially during this year’s Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) in July,” he said. Government has announced that this year’s Trade Fair will be held from July 20 to 23 at the Zimbabwe International Exhibition Centre in Bulawayo. Traditionally, during the ZITF period, visitors have had accommodation challenges due to shortage of hotel rooms and lodges. Mr Gomba said their expansion programme was part of efforts to contribute towards addressing the accommodation challenges in the city. “We took the opportunity to renovate and expand our lodge taking advantage of the national lockdowns induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. “And now that the ZITF will this year be held in July, we are certainly going to play our part as far as addressing accommodation challenges in Bulawayo is concerned,” he said. Through their renovation and expansion programme, Mr Gomba said Cycad’s rooms have been modernised and equipped with technological features that enhance comfort and easy communication for clients. — @okazunga
