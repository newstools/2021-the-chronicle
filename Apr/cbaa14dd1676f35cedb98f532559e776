KWEKWE City Council might be losing thousands of dollars due to illegal water connections by some unscrupulous residents, it has emerged. Speaking during a full council meeting recently, acting town clerk Dr Lucia Mnkandla expressed dismay over the increasing number of cases involving illegal water connections saying they were costing the local authority a lot of money. She said houses built recently in Mbizo 8 and some new structures were illegally connected to the local authority’s water system. “What is worrying is that the people are working with council workers and former council employees who go on to connect water illegally for a fee. It is a problem that we are trying to investigate and deal with once and for all because council cannot continue losing a lot of money through such shenanigans,” she said. Dr Mnkandla said due to illegal connections, some houses were not getting water. “Those who are facilitating the illegal connections are disturbing the whole system leaving some housing units not getting water. Those with newly built houses jump the gun and get water illegally as they try to make their houses habitable, but they do so at the expense of proper service delivery,” she said. Meanwhile, Kwekwe deputy mayor Councilor Shadreck Tobaiwa said council must stop sending water bills to some houses that have not been getting water for close to a decade.
