FESTUS Chinezhira Dumbu has been elected president of the Zimbabwe Boxing Federation (ZBF) after beating Goodwill Sibanda by 24 votes to two. The virtual elections had 28 delegates of whom two abstained in the vote for president, while three also abstained in the treasurer’s poll. Dumbu takes over the federation’s presidency that has been vacant since the death of Jim Mpalale last year. Major Isaac Goora and Arvian Mathe were elected unopposed for vice-president and secretary-general respectively, while Tambudzo Minezhi won the treasurer’s contest, pooling 21 votes to Kingstone Jokonya’s four. The four-member ZBF leadership of Dumbu, Goora, Mathe and Minezhi went on to make appointments in accordance with the ZBF constitution. Stephen Masiyambumbi retained the ZBF technical director’s role, with Energy Chenge (referees and judges committee), Misheck Mushawatu (marketing committee leader), Sarudzai Boroma (women’s committee) and Timothy Mpofu (medical and anti-doping). Mphilisi Sigabade Moyo was appointed senior national teams coach, while Alexander Kwangwari is in charge of juniors. -@ZililoR
