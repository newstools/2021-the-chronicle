HIGHLANDERS have tied down 18 first-team players, including one Under-20 player for the 2021 season. Seven players left the club last year and Bosso only concluded deals for Winston Mhango, Lynoth Chikukwa and Andrew Tandi while five senior players, skipper Ariel Sibanda, Nqobizitha Masuku, Godfrey Makarutse, Peter Muduhwa and Ray Lunga extended their contracts. Muduhwa was loaned to Tanzanian side Simba SC. “The squad hasn’t changed from what we had when we last updated the media and from what was presented to members at the AGM. The work to complete the squad for the coming season is in progress,” said the club spokesperson Ronald Moyo.\ <img class="wp-image-486838 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Ronald-Moyo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Ronald-Moyo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Ronald-Moyo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ronald Moyo He did not reveal the exact number of players that the club had tied down for the 2021 season, but head coach Mandla Mpofu said he only has 18 senior players out of the expected 25 and a single player in the Under-20 slot from the required five. “Presently we have 18 senior players and it’s obviously not an ideal situation. For the juniors’ slot we have a single youngster and we hope everything will be normal soon,” said Mpofu. Newly elected Highlanders supremo Johnfat Sibanda and his executive have to move with speed to assemble a full squad for the 2021 season whose league games are tentatively set to begin in just over a month’s time. For Bosso and Dynamos, however, the competitive season kicks off on April 18 when they clash in the Independence Cup final at Barbourfields Stadium in Bulawayo.
