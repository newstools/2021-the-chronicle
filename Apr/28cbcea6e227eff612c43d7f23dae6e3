The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter Chicken Inn says the Premier Soccer League has no obligation to take orders from the Footballers Union of Zimbabwe (FUZ), which they described as a mere pressure group not even constitutionally recognised by the PSL. The Gamecocks said threats of litigation if clubs do not abide by the players’ welfare organisation were a smokescreen meant to pressurise clubs into abiding by the FUZ’s unreasonable demands. In fact, the Bulawayo-based club says FUZ is free to approach the courts since it talks of the need to follow laws of the land, which also have never been against compensation of an agreived party for a service not rendered. “This is tantamount to players dictating what they want from clubs. We don’t mind about the expiry of contracts, but why is FUZ avoiding the issue of compensation? The laws of the land have never been against compensation. PSL has no obligation to abide by what the pressure group is saying. If the pressure group is talking of laws of the land let them go to court and  get an order to force clubs to accept the expiry of 2020 contracts and the issuance of  clearence letters. PSL are only directed by a legal directive from Zifa. So the circulation of such a letter to clubs  is only to create debate, not for clubs to follow,” said Chicken Inn secretary Tawengwa Hara. Hara’s comments come in the wake of a letter by FUZ secretary-general Thomas Sweswe to PSL chief executive officer Kennedy Ndebele pronouncing that FUZ does not believe in a contract rollover and clubs should negotiate contract extensions with players whose contracts expired last year. “Clubs have left FUZ dictating a lot of things to them yet they are not near both the Zifa and PSL stautes/constitutions. In terms of which section does PSL take instructions from FUZ,” said Hara.
