HIGHLANDERS have adopted a wait and see approach to the ultimatum by Football Union of Zimbabwe (FUZ) that Premier Soccer League clubs renegotiate player contracts that expired last year. In a letter to PSL chief executive officer Kennedy Ndebele, FUZ secretary-general Thomas Sweswe said there was nothing like a contract rollover despite there being no football the whole of last season due to lockdown restrictions introduced by Government to curb the spread of Covid-19. Clubs met their end of the bargain by continuing to pay player salaries monthly, although no service was being rendered.
Zifa released a statement on December 31 recommending that contracts that were initially set to expire in 2020 roll-over to this year, although the arrangement must be mutually beneficial to both parties. While Chicken Inn came out guns blazing and took aim at FUZ, Highlanders said they will wait for the forthcoming PSL assembly where the matter was likely to top the agenda, adding that they will stand guided by the assembly resolution. “It is our hope that this matter will be discussed at the forthcoming PSL assembly. It is our belief that there will be clarity and direction post that meeting,” said Highlanders’ spokesperson Ronald Moyo. Bosso lost Brian Banda to FC Platinum after his contract expired in June. Meanwhile, reigning champions FC Platinum refused to comment on the FUZ ultimatum. “We are not going to comment on this matter,” said spokesperson Chido Chizondo.
