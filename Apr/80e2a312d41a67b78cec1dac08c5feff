JOGGERS have been urged to be vigilant on the roads to avoid accidents that could at worst be fatal. This comes after a Bulawayo man was crushed to death by a haulage truck while jogging in the early hours of yesterday close to SOS Children’s Village. The man cannot be named because police are yet to inform his next of kin about the tragedy.
Similar accidents have been on the rise, prompting Bulawayo Athletics Board chairman Watson Madanyika to share notes on how to be safe when jogging on the city’s roads. “As an association responsible for athletics in the province, we always encourage our athletes and joggers to be very vigilant because they are not the only road users. We encourage them to put on reflective clothing so that other road users, especially motorists, can easily spot them. “In most cases the runner can see cars, but motorists don’t always see the runners. Therefore, reflective gear alerts drivers to a jogger’s presence on the roads,” said Madanyika. “Our joggers are also encouraged to follow the golden rule, which says they should run facing oncoming traffic and when they are tired, they must stop running because the more you tire the more your concentration levels drop. This is much safer than cars coming from behind you. If you’re in the dark or in dimly lit conditions, you’ll be able to see oncoming headlights. We strongly discourage joggers from using earphones or headphones because they prevent you from hearing other sounds such as a car horn.”
