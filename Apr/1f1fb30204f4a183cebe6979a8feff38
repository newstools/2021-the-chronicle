AMACIMBI harvesters have been overwhelmed by the much-loved delicacy this year due to Covid-19 induced restrictions as the second season of harvesting has started in most parts of Matabeleland South Province. With fewer takers but larger than usual occurence of the amacimbi due to good rains, the mopane worms are actually destroying vegetation. <img class="alignnone wp-image-539017 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ci.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ci.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/ci-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The above normal rains that were received this year in most parts of the country resulted in plenty of the protein-rich worms across many areas of Matabeleland South. Even Matabeleland North Province which does not usually report the worms, has plenty of the mouth-watering treat this year with Nyamandlovu, Nkayi and some parts of Tsholotsho having been blessed with their share. People have started harvesting amacimbi which have resurfaced for the second time as the delicacy has two seasons when the rains are good. Several people harvested amacimbi between December and January though it was subdued compared to other years due to Covid-19 with lockdown regulations which prevented inter-provincial traveling. In the past, some would even hire buses from other provinces and camp in Matabeleland South Province, ‘the home of amacimbi’ which caused environmental problems and raised the ire of locals. <img class="alignnone wp-image-539018 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/hgf.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/hgf.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/hgf-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Forestry Commission of Zimbabwe says this year has been unique as amacimbi seem to have overwhelmed harvesters but in the process overgrazed the mopane trees, their staple diet. “The second season of harvesting has started. This year the conditions were conducive for plenty of amacimbi in their traditional areas and for the second time in a year they have come back. But harvesters are few may be due to Covid 19. “We have also realised that because of the large numbers, trees are failing to support them. You will see them on the ground trying to find trees for feeding. Some end up being killed as they try to cross the road looking for leaves to feed on,” said Matabeleland South Forestry Commission Extension Officer, Mr Fortunes Felix Matutu. Mr Matutu said the rush which characterised the harvesting of amacimbi in the past has not been seen even under relaxed Covid-19 conditions this time with interprovincial travel allowed. <img class="alignnone wp-image-539021 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/cihgh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/cihgh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/cihgh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said because of that, the mopane worms have been able to reach maturity stage which is good for the future. “In the past, amacimbi would not reach maturity stage as harvesters would harvest them early because of competition. While it is good, they were able to mature, the problem of feed shortage is testimony that people have been wantonly cutting down mopane trees for fire wood and other uses,” he said. Mr Matutu said the good rains that were received this year meant that people also had their minds on their fields with bumper harvest expected. He said even locals are not fully committed to harvesting the worms despite their financial value. “The rain season also has played a part as many people have shifted focus to their fields because they have good harvests. They prefer to guard against birds and other animals that intrude into their fields. In the past because of poor rains, people would be having nothing in their fields so harvesting amacimbi became a source of their livelihoods,” said Mr Matutu. He said areas in Gwanda District like Kafusi, Insimbi, Mtshabezi, Timber Farm near Garanyemba,Colleen Bawn, River Block, Matobo, Mangwe and Bulilima have seen a second bite of the cherry this year. Mr Matutu said they received a report of someone who was fatally bitten by a snake while harvesting amcimbi in the week ending March 10 adding that every year such cases are recorded during harvest rush. “Our role is to train communities on woodlands management, community based natural resources management and we have also been encouraging them to formulate bylaws so they they also benefit from mopane worms in the case that there are outsiders who come to harvest. We are also developing a project where we want to promote the marketing of mopane worms as well as preservation of woodlands,” he said. Mr Matutu said they are working with some universities in the country to develop a feed formula for schools feeding using mopane worms. He said the institutions involved include the Food and Nutrition Council and University of Zimbabwe, Marondera University and Chinhoyi University. Chief Mathema of Gwanda District concurred saying amacimbi have been plenty this year which is bringing a set of new challenges. “My observations are that trees like mopane are leafless which will make cattle suffer during the dry spell as these leaves act as supplement feed at that time. The numbers of amacimbi is too much,” he said. Chief Mathema said despite Covid-19 bringing untold suffering worldwide, the pandemic helped control people who come from all over the country to harvest amacimbi. “This year we did not have those problems of people camping in our areas. The damage and challenges associated with that has been minimal this time. I urge our local communities to harvest and export amacimbi to other provinces as demand and prices will be good. They should use the proceeds to support schools by paying fees on time and other necessities,” said Chief Mathema. Environmental Management Agency Provincial manager for Matabeleland South Province, Mr Descent Ndlovu said: “The second season harvesting started last week and so far, I have not yet seen people who are camped for harvesting. I saw people from Gwanda town who travel same day and return. But I also realise that several of amacimbi are dying still young because of the challenge of feeding,” he said. Mr Ndlovu discouraged any would-be harvesters from camping in the bush as it has caused many environmental challenges like littering.
