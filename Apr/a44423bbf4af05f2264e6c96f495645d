The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter NOT even the return from suspension of Zimbabwe international defender Teenage Hadebe could help Turkish club Yeni Malatyaspor end their winless streak that has now stretched to 13 games following Monday’s goalless draw against Kasimpasa. Hadebe had missed his team’s previous two matches after picking up a red card just before joining the Warriors for last month’s Afcon qualifiers against Botswana and Zambia. Monday’s result left Malatyaspor hovering just above the relegation zone, as they remain rooted in 16th place on the league table with 34 points from 32 games. With games coming thick and fast, Malatyaspor are just a point above the drop zone with Keyserispor occupying the last relegation spot in 18th place with 33 points. Malatyaspor finished the 2019/20 season in 16th place and were only saved from playing in the lower division after the Turkish football authorities decided to increase the number of topflight teams to 21 from 18. This time around Hadebe’s side is fighting for survival. Malatyaspor coach Irfan Buz said: “There are competitions played in a row. We haven’t sheltered behind anything before and now we do not take shelter. It is not easy in this period. We had a draw in Fenerbache, of course we wanted to get three points from here, even if you cannot get three points, one point is also very important. “It was a very good game in terms of combat. It was fine on both sides. The second half was a vicious match. Acquah had a very clear position in the first half. If we got ahead 1-0 there, we would win. It could have been the other way around. I congratulate both teams. Our football players did their best.” Malatyaspor take on fifth-placed Alanyaspor PN Saturday knowing that defeat will cast them in the relegation waters. – @ZililoR
