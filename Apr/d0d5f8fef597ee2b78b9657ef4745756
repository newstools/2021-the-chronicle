The Chronicle Rugby will take a significant leap towards normality following SA Rugby’s announcement on Thursday that school and club rugby can resume this month. It has been a year since the sport has had to close the gates to club and school fields after the Covid-19 pandemic spread its tentacles around the country. SA Rugby said in a statement “while club teams received the go-ahead to return to play on Monday‚ 12 April‚ schools rugby will be able to resume with matches a little later‚ on Friday‚ 23 April.” It said the decision was made following an announcement by the department of basic education that it had made an Amendment of Directions in terms of Regulation 4(3) under the Disaster Management Act. But the clubs and schools will still have to take due care and closely follow all the necessary precautions. Schools rugby players‚ meanwhile‚ may resume contact training in four weeks — following six weeks of non-contact training — with the vision that they return to play at the earliest on Friday‚ 23 April.
