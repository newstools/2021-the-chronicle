The Chronicle Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Zimbabwe senior national cricket team captain, Heath Streak has been handed an eight-year ban from all involvement in the game by the International Cricket Council after he accepted five charges of breaching the ICC Anti-Corruption Code. In a statement released by the ICC on Wednesday, the 47-year old Streak was charged as a participant under the code by virtue of his status as the coach of Zimbabwe from 2016 to 2018 and as the coach of various domestic teams. The charges are as follows: According to the ICC, under the provisions of the Code, Streak chose to admit the charges and agreed the sanction with the ICC in lieu of an Anti-Corruption Tribunal hearing. He will be free to resume his involvement in the game on 28 March 2029. Alex Marshall, ICC General Manager, Integrity Unit, said: “Heath Streak is an experienced former international cricketer and national team coach, who had participated in numerous anti-corruption education sessions and was fully aware of his responsibilities under the Code. “As a former captain and coach, he held a position of trust and owed a duty to uphold the integrity of the game. He breached the Code on several occasions, including facilitating the approach of four other players. At times, he also sought to obstruct and delay our investigation. Marshall stated that Streak’s offences did not affect the outcomes of any relevant matches and the Zimbabwean has agreed to assist the ICC anti-corruption education programme for which the world cricket governing body is grateful. Streak has also expressed his remorse and contrition and entered this agreed sanction decision to avoid the need for a full disciplinary process, with the sanction reflective of his cooperation. @Mdawini_29
