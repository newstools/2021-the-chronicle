Following an April Fools Day story that we carried some two weeks ago purporting that Smokehouse was opening an eKasi branch in Nkulumane, the steakhouse’s proprietor, Ilan Wiesenbacher has felt compelled to give back to society through a hotdog luncheon that will be held in the suburb. Wiesenbacher who was the biggest fan of the prank has partnered with Nkulumane Ward 22 councillor, Rodney Jele and set this Sunday afternoon as the day they will host children from nearby orphanages, the elderly and disabled for a snacks fete. A target of 500 hotdogs and drinks has been set for beneficiaries who will be given in phases so as to adhere to Covid-19 regulations. Smokehouse general manager, Tafadzwa Machirori said: “We’re going to be hosting a hotdog and drinks snack at Nkulumane Hall by Sekusile shopping centre between 11am and 2pm on Sunday and preparations for this outing are at an advanced stage. <img class="alignnone wp-image-541462 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Smokehouse-stand.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Smokehouse-stand.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Smokehouse-stand-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The idea came about after the April Fool’s joke that gathered so much interest and hype in the Nkulumane community such that we decided to make good on the joke – for one day at least, for now. “My boss Ilan Wiesenbacher came up with the idea (of the luncheon), together with Councillor Jele,” Machirori said. She said the programme is meant to show appreciation to the Nkulumane community while also giving back to the Bulawayo society which has greatly supported their establishment since its inception some years back. “The programme is about showing love to a community that was so eager to welcome us. The main beneficiaries will be children from nearby orphanages, the elderly and the disabled. We’ll give out the hotdogs and drinks to people in phases so that we adhere to Covid-19 regulations. The target is to give out about 500 hotdogs and drinks,” said Machirori. Jele hailed the Smokehouse team for materialising a joke into an initiative that seeks to alleviate hunger and bring cheers to the community. “As a community, we’d like to thank the Smokehouse team for the initiative of giving back to the community at a time of Covid-19. We have a lot of orphans who’re not able to put food on the table and have an average of one meal per day. “This programme will really be helpful to the community in terms of alleviating hunger, even just for one day,” said Jele. He hopes the partnership turns long term. He went on to invite other well-wishers keen to feed vulnerable children in the community on a monthly basis to come on board. -@mthabisi_mthire.
