THE Olympic dream for Bulawayo-based amateur boxer Ndabezinhle Phiri has collapsed, with the Zimbabwe Boxing Federation (ZBF) saying the pugilist will not be able to garner enough points to enable him to qualify for the Tokyo Games. Phiri, an African flyweight champion, missed a competition in Tanzania in February after testing positive for Covid-19. Phiri and Mandlenkosi Marusenga tested positive for Covid-19 and they were forced to self-isolate while Trade Nkomozabo and Tabius Dzandiwandira travelled to Tanzania. The 20-year-old Phiri, had managed to navigate the Covid-19 challenges, doing shadow boxing at his Lobengula Boxing Club. ZBF technical director Stephen Masiyambumbi said time has run out for Phiri to haul enough points. “To be honest, it will not be possible to have our boxers competing in the Olympics. It’s unfortunate that our boxers failed to get qualifying tournaments after conditions of making it for the Olympics were changed. What happened is that there are points’ systems that were introduced and after failing to attend continental competitions last year because of Covid-19, our boxers lost points,” said Masiyambumbi. — @ZililoR
