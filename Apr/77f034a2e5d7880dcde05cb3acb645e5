The Chronicle Nike filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against MSCHF Product Studio following the launch of the sneakers. The so-called “Satan shoes” which allegedly contained a drop of human blood are to be recalled following a lawsuit from Nike. Lil Nas X, a rapper, helped launch the shoes, which were based on the Nike Air Max 97. Nike had filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against MSCHF Product Studio, the sellers of the footwear. As part of the settlement, the shoes will be recalled and buyers will be refunded by MSCHF “to remove them from circulation”. Only 666 pairs were made, and they sold for $1,018 (£741) a set. <img class="wp-image-540230 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/lil-nas1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/lil-nas1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/lil-nas1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A pentagram, a symbol of Satanism, adorns the top of the shoes.

As well as the Satan shoes, refunds will also be offered by MSCHF to those who bought the Jesus shoes, also based on the Air Max 97, which were launched in 2019. Limited edition shoes like these become collectors items and can reach values many times more than the original price on the second-hand market. David Bernstein, chair of the intellectual property litigation group at Debevoise & Plimpton and MSCHF representative, said the artistic messages MSCHF hoped the shoes would convey were “dramatically amplified” by Nike’s lawsuit. He said: “MSCHF intended to comment on the absurdity of the collaboration culture practiced by some brands, and about the perniciousness of intolerance. “Having achieved its artistic purpose, MSCHF is pleased to have resolved the lawsuit.” Lil Nas X was not listed as a defendant in the litigation. <img class="wp-image-540233 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/lil-nas2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/lil-nas2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/lil-nas2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The shoes feature a reference to a Bible verse.

Nike has claimed that even those who collect shoes were confused about who was making the Satan shoes. MSCHF said the shoes were “individually numbered works of art” and did not cause confusion. Lil Nas X released a devil-themed video for his song Montero (Call Me By Your Name) in March. – Sky News
