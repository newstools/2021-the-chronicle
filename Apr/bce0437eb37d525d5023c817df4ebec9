The fans have been amazing and it’s humbling that I now have more fans here that are not Zimbabweans as evidenced by the two shows we had in Cape Town. “By public demand, we’ll actually be back in Cape Town for another show in a totally different area, the Cape coloured market. Nox brand is huge thereafter the national success of My Melody featuring Master KG, Mufaro and Kure Kure with Tyfah and Master KG as well,” said Nox. He said his new fans are revisiting his past works as they get an appreciation of his works. “Interesting enough, my South African fans are now going back into my vast music catalogue with other songs becoming hits in the South African community among them Uchandifunga, Kana Ndinewe, Havanyare, Waimutambisa and Toitasei. “Godobori which features Makhadzi and Mr Brown is among the biggest current hits in South Africa,” said Nox. – @mthabisi_mthire
