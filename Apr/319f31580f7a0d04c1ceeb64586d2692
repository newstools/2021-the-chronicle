Rhumba legend Themba “Boyoyo” Mathe has given his fans an Easter present in the form of his 10th album, Sebethatha Amachance that was launched on Good Friday in South Africa. The launch at Thembisa grounds, Johannesburg featured performances by Josiah “Nswabanda” Nkomo and The Legends band and Eze Energy among others. Speaking through his manager, Walter “SaZinto” Ndlovu, Boyoyo who is a former lead vocalist of Mokis Connection, urged fans to support him by buying the original CD and desist from buying pirated copies. He said it was sad how, after putting in a lot of work into the recording of the album, there were pirates waiting to harvest where they did not sow. “This is my 10th studio album (excluding the ones I did with Mokis Connection, Ezinkulu Zase Khezi, and other bands I’ve worked with). Some of the songs in the album include Umona, Umuntu, Ukuhlupheka kwami, Marvelous and Satane,” Boyoyo said. His management said they are now working on logistics to bring the album to Zimbabwe so that his local fans get their copies. The Irene hit-maker said the album which was recorded at TK Mobile Studios is available on digital stores. “We worked with Mtshayazafe on bass, Courage Kuriko on lead, Honest maOsto Khumalo on rhythm as well as TK of Dubia Masters who also played rhythms and Thabani on drums. I also added some of my past tracks which I reworked as fans had been complaining that they were no longer accessible,” he said. Boyoyo who is now blind spent much of his time with Mokis Connection as the lead vocalist. His loss of sight, however, has not deterred him, as he has continued to produce music with his 10th solo album being testimony. — @themkhust.
