VETERAN journalist and former Chronicle Sports Editor Innocent Kurwa (63) died early yesterday morning after his car, a Nissan Almera, was involved in a head on collision along Leopold Takawira Avenue in Bulawayo. The accident occurred on Saturday at around 9PM near Ascot Shopping Centre and Kurwa succumbed to the injuries at the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) at around 2AM yesterday. Witnesses said Kurwa was travelling from the city centre heading to his home in Sunninghill suburb. Soon after passing the UBH turn-off, another vehicle emerged from the opposite direction and encroached onto his traffic lane resulting in a collision. Kurwa was trapped in the wreckage and the ambulance crew later managed to rescue him. He was taken to the UBH where he succumbed to the injuries at about 2AM. Sunday News Senior Reporter Robin Muchetu, who arrived at the scene a few minutes after the accident, said she managed to contact an ambulance, which took Kurwa to UBH. “I arrived at the scene at around 9PM and he was still trapped in the wreckage. He managed to recognise me as he was groaning in pain and I immediately called an ambulance, which took him to UBH,” she said. “When they took him to hospital, I thought he would make it, but sadly I received a call from nurses at UBH at around 2AM this morning notifying me of his death.” <img class="wp-image-543044 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Pic-for-story.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Pic-for-story.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Pic-for-story-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The wreckage of Kurwa’s vehicle Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said the driver of the other car, a Jaguar sedan was speeding and encroached onto the lane of oncoming traffic resulting in the two cars colliding. “I can confirm that two cars, a Nissan Almera and Jaguar were involved in a head on collision along Leopold Takawira Avenue near Ascot Shopping Centre on Saturday night.
