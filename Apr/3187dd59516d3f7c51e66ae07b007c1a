The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent FORMER Zimpraise member, Martha Longwe who broke away from the group in 2018 released her single titled Ofana Naye last week that saw the highest bidder forking out US$500 in support of the artiste who is trying to raise funds for her second album. The track is the songstress’ first production since her debut album, Ingoma Yothando that was released in 2019. Longwe said she was supposed to launch her second album in September last year but had to shelve these plans because of financial constraints. She said the proceeds from sales of the single will be directed towards her upcoming album post production, for both audio and visuals. “I decided to launch my single Ofana Naye which is a song that simply declares that there’s no-one like Jesus. I decided to release it online in order to lure a larger audience as we can’t hold physical shows. “My producer then suggested that we use proceeds from the single to fund my album that’ll likely be out by May,” said the Ntabazinduna-born musician who is now based in Harare. “It was really a humbling moment to see the MCs, gospel artiste BK and Zuda join forces with me to make this launch a success. Among the guests were Ntombiyosizi ‘Ncane’ Sibanda and Apostle Fire,” said Longwe. Turning to her plans for this year, Longwe said she will up her game and start doing live shows unlike in the past where she only performed in churches. The musician started her career at the age of 19 under Gari na Gride group and then became a backing vocalist for Mann Ronna. – @mthabisi_mthire
