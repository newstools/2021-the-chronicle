The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent UP-AND-COMING hip hop musician, X’s (real name Promise Radebe) single titled Back to Me (Remix) which he released last week has been given a thumbs up by fans because of its informative message. The track which is about the life of teenagers has a magical flow with the lyrics being a narration of how the artiste was faced with depression at a young age. It could have not been released at a better time as the topic of depression is currently trending as more and more people are opening up about their battles. The release of the track undeniably earned X new fans who have since called on him to work on more productions. X said he will gladly do so. Commenting on the single on YouTube, one Cele-Stiale Damage wrote: “Dope bro, the flow on this is too legit.” Jose San Erico: “Cool vibe, more grace lad, keep up,” while fellow musician Stewie La Savage concurred with the words, “Fire Fire.” Reflecting on the appreciation of the song, X said: “Back To Me (Remix) which was released on April 3 has really opened more doors for me due to my creativity. I used the flashback technique so as to get the audience to understand more about my deeds and in as much as it an expressive track, I not only aimed to share my past, but also to encourage other teens out there to stop drug and substance abuse as it is very harmful.” The 18-year-old rapper said he has taken up the challenge to work on more productions and will soon release a six-track mixtape titled Life on his birthday (September 11). The mixtape will tackle different issues like depression, GBV and drug abuse. – @mthabisi_mthire
