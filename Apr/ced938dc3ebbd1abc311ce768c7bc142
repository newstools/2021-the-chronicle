It seems like with each fortnight, social media sensation Madam Boss (real name Tarisai Cleopatra Chikocho) is announcing an endorsement deal or acting gig, with most now referring to her as the corporate face of Zimbabwe. Some of the comedian’s endorsements include Nash Paints, NetOne, Primket Travel and Tours, Skylake Boreholes, Elaine Solar, Senditoo and Nyaradzo with the most recent one being with Ingwebu Breweries. Besides being a brand ambassador for these renowned companies, Madam Boss who has her own makeup and fragrance range called Red by Madam Boss, has also been introduced to the world of acting where she is clinching roles like no man’s business. First was a role on a South African series last month that was followed closely by another on a Nigerian series, The Offsprings. For both productions, she had an opportunity to work closely with renowned actors from the two countries. It is every celebrity’s dream to bag at least one endorsement as it shows that his or her brand is worthy. As for acting roles, most experienced actors have been waiting for years to bag such roles outside the country as they expose one to wider audiences. But, why have these regional productions chosen Madam Boss, a novice in the world of acting yet there are many experienced actors in the country one may ask. In fact, how is she bagging all these deals, especially at a time when the local arts industry is not as active due to Covid-19 effects? After all, Madam Boss is just a “mere” social media sensation who has not quite performed on any notable big stage. Some have also been saying they are tired of seeing Madam Boss advertising for every company in Zimbabwe bringing us back to the question, why Madam Boss? Below are some of the likely reasons why most corporates and TV producers are opting to work with the personality.
Humble nature Having moved from rags to riches, Madam Boss, an orphan who had a rough upbringing, has remained humble, instead opting to uplift others as she knows how it feels to be neglected and looked down upon. This likely explains why most companies/ production houses are opting for her because of this unique character. Watching Madam Boss interact with Madlela Skhobokhobo and the production team in South Africa during her stint there last month, it was clear that this was a woman who was out to rise with others as she used her social media accounts to promote all those she was working with, from makeup artistes, fellow actors, producers and her casting agency. For all we know, one of the people she was working with in South Africa may have linked her up with the Nigerian deal. Easy going
Watching Madam Boss, one can tell that she is vibrant, fun and very easy going. This character makes her quite appealing as she seems simple to approach. Authenticity
Maybe most of our personalities have been missing the plot by trying too hard to portray a life that is not theirs in order to belong and please people. In the process, they have lost their identity and plot. Madam Boss on the other hand, from the onset, has remained true to herself. “I don’t know how to speak English . . . I didn’t perform well at school,” Madam Boss has always told fans with some mocking her. But, this has never deterred her and it is paying off for her as this originality is what is attracting people and definitely taking her places. Confirming this, Dr Henry Obidi, the Nigerian producer of The Offsprings production that Madam Boss is featuring in, stated that they opted for Madam Boss as they wanted someone who would authentically represent Zimbabweans. “Madam Boss was selected to introduce Zimbabwean food to Nigerians. That’s why in the series, we accommodated the Zimbabwean language and culture because we wanted her to represent her country effectively. I’m so glad she’s one of the main people on the series. “She’s doing Zimbabwe proud in Nollywood and because of her, we have huge respect for every one of you in Zimbabwe,” Obidi said in an interview. This originality likely explains the comedian’s close to half-a-million followers on Facebook as she tackles issues as they are, making it easy for many to relate to her skits. Adaptability
Madam Boss is gifted when it comes to adapting as she rapidly learns new skills and behaviours. When she was in South Africa, she embraced the cultures there, same applies to Nigeria. This makes her more alluring as she can flow with pretty much anything. Influencer
Finally, Zimbabweans are embracing the concept of influencers and Madam Boss is topping the list. An influencer is basically someone who has the power to affect the purchasing decisions of others because of their authority, knowledge, position, or relationship with their audience which they actively engage. Due to this status, Madam Boss who is proving to be very powerful as an influencer, is successfully raking in all the endorsements as companies are guaranteed that their products will be marketed well through her engagements with her followers. Brand visibility/ appropriateness
Nowadays, everything has gone virtual. Most endorsement deals are being struck based on one’s presence on social media as most of the marketing is taking place there. This likely explains why most companies are falling for Madam Boss as she has a huge following online. And, it is not just about having a huge following, but the appropriateness of the brand. Some brands are marred with dirty content as the personalities tend to get sucked into petty fights online which tend to dent their images. Madam Boss, on the other hand, has often played it cool, refusing to comment each time people drag her name into the mud. This has worked well for her as most companies are proud to associate with her as her image is appropriate. <img class="alignnone wp-image-542635 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Untitled-55.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Untitled-55.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Untitled-55-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Unlike many of these female social media influencers, Madam Boss is focused and does not get involved in all this swearing, shouting, using vulgar language, showing herself naked and being inappropriate on social media. I have come to realise that she is genuinely talented,” commented one user on Facebook. Creativity, visibility
Still on digital platforms. Despite one having thousands of followers, they need to consistently upload fresh content so as to keep these people interested in their brand. Madam Boss has been very good at this as no day passes by without her engaging with her fans. Nothing beats her live videos as people get to catch up with her in real-time, creating a bond between her and her followers. This makes one stand out and more appealing. Strong support unit
Behind every successful woman, there is a family that trusts her, they say. This rings true for Madam Boss as her husband Ngoni Munetsiwa “Mhofela” has undeniably been a strong support system. In fact, he could be the brains behind this brand and the one responsible for most of the marketing and ultimate endorsements as he is very active when it comes to Madam Boss’ line of trade. Perseverance
Madam Boss, an orphan, was once a housemaid hence the birth of her comedy character which was inspired by the various people she worked for. She could have spent the rest of her life as a maid as she did not perform well at both primary and high school. But her determination has led to her doing many things she never imagined. Now, many years later, it is paying dividends as she is now the country’s most sought-after personality. Who would have ever thought? This perseverance is showing in her acting career as the roles are challenging because this is her first time acting. Her little education is also complicating things as she is failing to read and pronounce some of the English words. But, never one to give up, she is spending sleepless nights mastering the scripts coupled with terrible migraines and if the Nigerian producer’s words are anything to go by, Madam Boss is nailing it. Prayer
In God, Madam Boss trusts. In all she does, she has been putting God first, often taking time to thank Him for her successes.
Whatever the case, Madam Boss is rising and locals should look out for her as she is taking the country’s arts scene to dizzying heights.
