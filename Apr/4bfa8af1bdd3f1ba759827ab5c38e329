BULAWAYO City FC players received their Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday , as the club moved towards fully complying with requirements for the return of football. Having been among the first Premier Soccer League clubs to conduct Covid-19 tests a fortnight ago, City heeded the PSL’s call for interested clubs to take up free vaccination being rolled out by the government. City players, technical and support staff as well as board members took their Covid-19 vaccine jabs at the City Hall. Siboniso Khumalo, a board member of the municipal sponsored side, said taking up the vaccination is an indication of their commitment to fighting the virus and urged others to protect themselves by following suit. “No one is being forced to take up the Covid-19 vaccination and I must commend the players, staff and councillors who took a leading role by taking the jab. A healthy city is the resoonsibility of everyone and by taking the Covid-19 vaccine we are demystifying the myth and falsewoods that have been spread by some people about the vaccination. “As a club we strongly believe that we are protecting ourselves as we get ready for football activities. Everyone has been itching for football to return and we hope all goes well,” said Khumalo. He said despite taking up the Covid-19 vaccine, they will keep on practicing recommended hygiene as well as adhering to the standard operating protocols. – @ZililoR
