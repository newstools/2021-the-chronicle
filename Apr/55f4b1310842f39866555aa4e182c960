GOVERNMENT has donated food and face masks to people at Jairos Jiri Training Centre and Sir Humphrey Gibbs Training Centre in Bulawayo. Jairos Jiri is home to 150 people with disabilities while Sir Humphrey Gibbs has 80 people with mental challenges.
The Deputy Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Cde Lovemore Matuke handed over the donations to representatives of the two institutions. Each of the two centres received rice and cooking oil. Deputy Minister Matuke who was on a tour of the homes, said the institutions are now on Government’s priority list. Other people with disabilities who live in Bulawayo also met Cde Matuke at Jairos Jiri Training Centre and were given masks. “We are here today to let you know that the Government has taken full responsibility for your welfare. In the rural areas some of your colleagues are getting grain. The situation is different here in towns hence the Government has put in place a budget from which you will be getting an amount of money to cushion you,” said Deputy Minister Matuke. He told superintendents at the institutions that they must work to prevent the spread of Covid -19 as it has proved to be deadly. Deputy Minister Matuke encouraged people to consider vaccination as it will help reduce fatalities. “Some of the people here are already vulnerable, these masks are a message that Covid-19 is a reality and it is deadly. I therefore implore you to consider taking the jab as it is safe for all of us as citizens. You should borrow a leaf from your leaders who got vaccinated, the President, the Vice-President, many other leaders and I here in Bulawayo got vaccinated,” said Deputy Minister Matuke. Accepting the donation, Jairos Jiri manager Mr Tafadzwa Gochai thanked Government for the assistance. “The gesture by the Government is a noble one. All of us here agree with me that in most cases people living with disabilities are forgotten. Society out there sometimes being influenced by myths does not have the courage to look after these people let alone giving them some money. Training them seems to be a waste of resources hence my joy towards the Government’s monetary assistance. Sir Humphrey Gibbs superintendent Mrs Spiwe Mwenda said the intervention by Government demonstrates its commitment to better the lives of people with disabilities. <img class="wp-image-542481 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/hat.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/hat.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/hat-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Deputy Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Cde Lovemore Matuke assists one of the beneficiaries at Jairos Jiri Association in Bulawayo to wear a mask yesterday She said they were facing food shortages and are still suffering from the effects of service disruptions caused by the outbreak of the pandemic. “As a home, we are delighted by the help we are getting from Government. Training people needs a lot of money and so is feeding and caring for them. People here, like other human beings, have extra needs that the centre cannot provide. The money from Government will therefore cover that gap. We are thankful to the ministry for coming down to the roots to listen to our challenges.” she said. A woman who uses a wheelchair from Mzilikazi suburb, Ms Deliwe Moyo (50) who spoke to Chronicle expressed gratitude at the move by Government to provide them with cash. She said she is a vendor and requires R200 a month for rentals, an amount that she said is difficult to raise. “The masks are a second joy to me but I am very happy about the money. I have been struggling to feed myself because from my vending activities I have to raise R200 for rent. At times I have to borrow money from others so I have been living in perpetual debt. I am hopeful that the money will at least cater for my food while my vending money goes to the rentals,” she said. A man from Nguboyenja suburb Mr Terrence Nxumalo (24) who is also living with disabilities said his dream was to raise capital to buy goods for resale to avoid burdening others. “The money, if it comes, I want to use it to buy goods for resale like others are doing. I have the energy and all that I need is the capital to start the business,” he said. — @jdgjarachara
