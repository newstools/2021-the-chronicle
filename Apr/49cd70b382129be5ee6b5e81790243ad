THE national men’s Under-21 field hockey side is expected to resume training next month in preparation for the Junior Africa Cup in August. Team manager Hannigton Sibanda said while they are awaiting the official venue and competition dates, they were not leaving things to chance. “The Under-21 tournament in August was initially set to be held in Ghana but that changed so we are expecting an announcement this week to confirm where the competition will be held. We hope it will be somewhere in Southern Africa. “We are still finalising our plans and next month we will resume training. We have already received the green light and all our Covid-19 mitigation protocols are in order. The venue we will use for our training sessions is St George’s College (in Harare) and it has already matched the (safety) standards set by the Sports and Recreation Commission. The Hockey Association of Zimbabwe has certain guidelines which each person should follow,” said Sibanda. Their immediate fight is to get players to full fitness as soon as possible. The Under-21 men’s side had been training in groups in Chiredzi, Bulawayo and Harare before the Covid-19 outbreak. Coach Fidelis Majuba had called up 24 players to the squad and those are the same players that will resume training next month. – @innocentskizoe
