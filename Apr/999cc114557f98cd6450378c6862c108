A SHEBEEN queen from Bulawayo was arrested for allegedly scalding with hot water a customer who had come to collect his change. Brilliant Hlomai (34) of Ntabazinduna flats in Mzilikazi suburb appeared before Tredgold magistrate Ms Learnear Khumalo facing charges of assaulting Mr Kgomotso Nkosi (27), from the same area. <img class="wp-image-539622 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/scalded-shebeen-patron.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/scalded-shebeen-patron.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/scalded-shebeen-patron-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Kgomotso Nkosi Hlomai was not asked to plead but was remanded in custody to 12 April as the court awaits a medical report on the extent of Mr Nkosi’s injuries. Appearing for the State, Mr Terrence Chakabuda told the court that Nkosi and Hlomai had a misunderstanding over US$2. “On Saturday around 7.20PM and at Ntabazinduna Flats, Hlomai had a misunderstanding with Nkosi who is her customer over US$2. The accused told the complainant that his change had been collected by his friend. This did not go down well with Mr Nkosi and resulted in a misunderstanding. The accused went inside her house and came out with a jug full of boiling water which she poured on the complainant’s upper left arm,” he said. — @jdgjarachara
