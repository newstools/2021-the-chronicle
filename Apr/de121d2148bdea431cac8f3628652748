Madlela Skhobokhobo’s tagline, “A dream never dies” seems to be coming to reality as the actor and musician is slowly being recognised for his immense talent. He recently landed what could be one of his biggest gigs as he appeared on South Africa’s Cambridge Foods Easter special advert. The advert ran on various channels on Open View and DStv, platforms that have millions of viewers. Madlela’s jovial mood fits in perfectly with the advert’s storyline which portrayed the happiness of families. For Madlela, featuring on this advert was a sign that the Lord whom he worships and values, was blessing his talent on a daily basis. “It was exciting being part of the Easter special advert. Cambridge Foods is huge in South Africa and being associated with them was a great thing for my career. It showed that for sure, a dream never dies,” said Madlela. Madlela who is now back in Zimbabwe, was in South Africa recently to shoot a series which he is also starring in alongside comedian, Madam Boss. It was through that series shoot that Madlela bagged the advert deal through his casting agency, Becky Casting Agency. Although his acting career is somehow sailing smoothly, Madlela who is famed for his axe-wielding antics called on the Government to fully reopen the arts sector. “This coronavirus has affected us a lot as we haven’t played with my band for a very long time. That’s really worrying and I wish things could ease so that we can be able to work and entertain our fans. Besides this hiccup, things are looking good on the film and business side and I hope the advert I just did will propel my brand to the next level,” said Dlelas, as he is also fondly known. Madlela is really a man on a mission because while pursuing his acting career across the Limpopo, he was also pushing his cross-border trading venture that he recently embarked on to try and diversify his streams of income. -@mthabisi_mthire.
