THE Warriors moved five places up the Fifa rankings that were released by the world football gorvening body on Wednesday. The senior national football side moved from position 112th to 107th in the world and also moved two places up the Caf rankings to 24th. Senegal remain Africa’s highest-ranked nation, but they dropped two spots in the overall ranking following their two draws in their final two Afcon 2021 qualifiers. Having qualifed for their third successive Afcon finals, the Warriors will now shift their qualifiers to the 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifiers. The Warriors are in Group G with neighbours South Africa, West African giants Ghana and Ethiopia. The Warriors will begin their campaign against South Africa between June 5-8 in Harare, before travelling to Ethiopia a week later. They will then resume their qualification journey with back-to-back ties against the Black Stars of Ghana in September. – @innocentskizoe
