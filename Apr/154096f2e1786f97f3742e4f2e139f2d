TALENTED dancer-cum-singer, Sandra Ndebele-Sibindi has enrolled with the Midlands State University for a Bachelor of Social Sciences Music Business, Musicology and Technology Honours undergraduate degree programme. Sandy, as the artiste is fondly known by many, made headlines in 2016 after she sat for O-level Mathematics exams at the age of 34. The mother of three passed the supplementary Mathematics paper in 2016 and went on to pass her A-level subjects in 2020. Speaking to Chronicle Showbiz from the university’s main campus in Gweru yesterday as she was preparing to write Level 1:1 examinations, Sandy said she is slowly finding her feet at her new home. She said she decided to enrol at the university as she feels she could have achieved more with her music and businesses if she was educated. <img class="alignnone wp-image-539559 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Sandra-Ndebele-student-card.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Sandra-Ndebele-student-card.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Sandra-Ndebele-student-card-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I’ve been there, done that and travelled the world. I have it all but have no education. The reason I went back to school is that I felt I could be far with my musical career and other professions if I’d been educated,” said Sandy. She urged fellow artistes to strive to improve their education saying education will help improve the arts sector. “Let’s educate ourselves as artistes to improve the creative sector of the arts industry. You can do it and I’m a living testimony,” she said. — @mthabisi_mthire.
