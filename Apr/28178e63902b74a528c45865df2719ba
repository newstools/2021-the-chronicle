ENGLAND-based Warriors midfielder Marvelous Nakamba has paid first term tuition for 1 000 pupils around the country though his foundation. The Aston Villa midfielder last year registered a trust to manage the Marvelous Nakamba Foundation (MNF) as part of his way of giving back to local communities by creating a platform for youth development and life skills capacitation. The foundation also seeks to assist the needy and less privileged. “Following up on the Foundation pledge to ensure education to the underprivileged, the foundation is happy to announce that it has completed the paying of school fees for 1 000 students across the country for term one, 2021. This has been a long-standing aim of the foundation to ensure that we aide students and offer them a chance to their right to education. <img class="alignnone wp-image-541020 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/MNF.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/MNF.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/MNF-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The opening of schools after a long layoff due to Covid comes as a welcome development as we continue to champion education. This is a follow up to the 2020 year where we paid school fees in our inaugural year as a foundation,” read a statement from the foundation. The 1 000 learners were selected by working closely with school heads and teachers and of them were drawn from schools in underprivileged communities around the country. Nakamba said he hoped this gesture will go a long way in helping not only the students that benefited, but bring relief to parents or guardians that have been struggling to raise school fees. “This sits well with us, as the saying goes, ‘it takes a nation to raise a child’. On this same breadth, we are glad that a majority of the student beneficiaries for the 2020 school fees did extremely well and we hope that the 2021 first term students will excel in their studies. For now, we have gone to as far as 1 000 students, but we desire to go for more when funds permit,” said Nakamba. Other foreign-based players that have foundations are Kudakwashe Mahachi, Khama Billiat and Tino Kadewere. – @innocentskizoe
