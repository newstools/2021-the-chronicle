The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter TRADE development and promotion agency, ZimTrade, says increased engagement with regional markets is critical as the country explores opportunities for local products following the operationalisation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Trading under the historic trade regime began on January 1 this year and is seen as significant stride towards continental economic integration. In a latest update ZimTrade said it was conducting a market survey in Tanzania while a pre-mission assessment of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) market would be undertaken next week. “Following the commencement of trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area in January this year, ZimTrade is increasing its engagements with regional markets to explore opportunities for local products and services,” said the agency. “ZimTrade is currently conducting a market survey in Tanzania, running from 12-23 April and a pre-mission assessment in Democratic Republic of Congo, which is running from 12-16 April.” The two in-market activities are expected to provide market intelligence that will help Zimbabwean companies get an insight on products that have an export potential, market requirements as well as the export penetration strategies that can be adopted for the above markets.
