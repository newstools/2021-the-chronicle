The tracks are Nu-Era, All way, Sayisusa, Umlilo, With time, Boss Moves and At night. “I started recording music in 2017 and managed to record 10 songs although unprofessionally. This year, I got a manager, Masotha Nzou (Sungura Masters founder) and with his tutelage, I ventured into the industry professionally. “My hope is to be the voice of the voiceless and promote my home area through my craft,” said T_Phraze. The former Mpopoma High student said before he ventured into music, he was a writer and was passionate about soccer. “I also did beatboxing at Mpopoma High and students from my stream would gather just to watch me perform during break time,” said T_Phraze. – @mthabisi_mthire
