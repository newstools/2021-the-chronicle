The Chronicle Midlands Bureau Chief Premier Soccer League (PSL) returnees Whawha FC have stepped up their pre-season preparations after all players and officials were tested for Covid-19 on Wednesday. The Whawha technical team led by head coach Luke Petros-Jukulile was in a bullish mood yesterday ahead of the new season. The Zimbabwe Prison and Correctional Services (ZPCS) team’s target is to avoid the chop. The PSL has proposed the weekend of May 15-16 to start all competitions following government’s nod for all sporting activities to resume, albeit under strict Covid-19 guidelines, which include testing for the virus before any activity. Whawha are brimming with confidence that they will impress this season. The Gweru-based side has been playing its cards close to its chest although it retains high hopes of laying claim to the prized gong. Having started training on Tuesday, they are confident that they will hold their own against the big boys of local football. Petros-Jukulile said they were grateful to the government and Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) for the green light given to the PSL. “We want to thank the government and SRC for giving us this opportunity to resume football action and I can assure our fans that Whawha FC will be a force to reckon with this season. We will fight tooth and nail with our boys and finish the season in a respectable position,” said Petros-Jukulile. Whawha lost some of their influential players such as Lameck Nhamo and Simon Shoko who are back with their parent club FC Platinum after the expiry of their loan deals.
