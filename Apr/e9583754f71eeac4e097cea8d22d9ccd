The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent THE Zimbabwe Centre of the International Theatre Institute will today select a new 10-member executive. The meeting will be held via Zoom meeting and WhatsApp platform as from 2pm. The organisation’s co-ordinator, Lloyd Nyikadzino said the new executive will be tasked to map the way forward on theatre tapping into the new normal. The theatre sector was largely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic last year and this year as arts gatherings remain suspended. “Membership to the institute is open to all theatre professionals and it’s individual based. The call is for all actors and actresses, directors, playwrights, theatre critics, choreographers, dancers, set designers and managers. “We’ll be having our elections today via Zoom and WhatsApp to accommodate those with data challenges,” said Nyikadzino. The organisation which is a member of the International Theatre Institute was formed in 2010. Ten members, Zane Lucas (chairperson), Joanna Powell (vice-chairperson), Lloyd Nyikadzino (coordinator), Daniel Maphosa (treasurer), Elizabeth Muchemwa (development officer), Stephen Chifunyise (committee member), Jasen Mpepho (committee member), Leroy Gono (committee member), Eunice Ratidzo Tava (committee member) and Jingo James (committee members) were elected. Since the establishment of the centre, the late Chifunyise had been paying for its subscription to the international mother body. The Zimbabwe Centre of the International Theatre is registered locally with the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe as a member-based organisation of professional theatre practitioners. It is an affiliate of the International Theatre Institute (ITI), the world’s largest performing arts organisation founded in 1948 by theatre and dance experts and UNESCO. – @mthabisi_mthire
