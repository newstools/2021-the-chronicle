The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Chronicle Correspondent EMBAKWE High School in Mangwe district, Matabeleland South province which is battling a Covid-19 outbreak has gone for five months without electricity and is appealing for assistance for power to be restored. The transformer that supplies the school, the mission and hospital broke down last year and the area has no electricity. Efforts have been made to engage Zesa which made two visits to the area but nothing materialised. The school as of Saturday had 91 positive cases. The absence of electricity is straining close monitoring of the situation at the school with candles and torch lights being used for lighting purposes and firewood for cooking purposes.In an interview yesterday, Mangwe legislator Cde Hlalani Mguni said the school had approached her and urgently wants a transformer to be put in the area. “The school has approached me after sending the news that they have gone without electricity for months now since November 1 last year. They need their transformer to be replaced and this they need it urgently in order to monitor all day and night the situation and curb the spread of the virus. “The School Head says Zesa was informed and brought to the site to check more than twice but so far nothing has come out of the inspections,” said Cde Mguni. She also urged well-wishers to assist the school with Protective Personal Equipment (PPEs).“The school is calling for assistance to have the transformer replaced and assistance also in terms of PPEs for future use too.  As a constituency we are calling on well-wishers to come forward and help our children,” said Cde Mguni. Efforts to get a comment from Zesa were not successful. -@mthabisi_mthire
