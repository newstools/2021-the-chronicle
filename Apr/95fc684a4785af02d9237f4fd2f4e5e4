A 23-YEAR-OLD Victoria Falls man will live to rue the day he decided to set wire snares to trap animals for meat at the Victoria Falls Water Works after he was sentenced to nine months in jail for the offence. Mcebisi Vundla who resides at the council water works compound and is employed as a builder by Kiggen Construction, was targeting impalas, duikers, kudus, warthogs and other small animal species that frequent the water works to drink water. He was charged with setting “class one” wire snares and pleaded guilty before Victoria Falls magistrates Ms Linda Dzvene. Asked why he committed the offence, Vundla said he wanted meat. The magistrate slapped Vundla with nine months in jail before suspending three months on condition that he does not commit a similar offence within five years. The other six months were also suspended on condition that Vundla completes 210 hours of community service at Victoria Falls Police Camp Clinic. Prosecuting, Mr Asher Chindedza said Vundla set three “class one” wire snares near the water works. A team of anti-poaching scouts discovered the snares during a patrol, before laying an ambush. The team apprehended Vundla when he turned up to check on his snares. No animal had been trapped at the time of the arrest. “The anti-poaching team discovered some wire snares and sought permission to lay an ambush. The accused then appeared at the scene to check on his wire snares and the scouts pounced on and arrested him. He led the team to where he had set other snares which were all recovered,” said Mr Chindedza.-@NyikaLingani
