FOLLOWING a disappointing 2020/21 first-class cricket season in which they were winless in the Logan Cup, Bulawayo’s Tuskers cricket franchise have turned their focus on the T20 competition that starts in Harare on Saturday. The former Logan Cup champions finished the first-class season in fourth position on the five-team table with just 10 points accumulated from two draws and two defeats. Tuskers players returned from the Easter holiday looking geared up for the upcoming T20 tournament when they took to the training field at Queens Sports Club yesterday. Nichols Singo, the Tuskers administrator, said the T20 and the upcoming Pro-50 tournaments present an opportunity for them to end the season with something in their trophy cabinet. “The players are back at training and they all raring to go. The players are training in preparation for the Twenty20 competition which starts on April 10 in Harare. After the T20, there’s a proposal to have a domestic break and have the Southern Region clashing with the Northern Region in preparation for the Pakistan tour. “The last calendar event is the Pro-50, which Tuskers will also fight for,” said Singo. Zimbabwe will play Pakistan in two Test matches as well as three Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) at Harare Sports Club this month and next month behind closed doors. The T20I series is scheduled to run from the 21st to 25th of this month while the first Test matches will be contested from 29th of this month to 3 May and the second Test is scheduled for May 7-11. Pakistan are expected to arrive in Zimbabwe on the 17th of this month after their tour of South Africa for three one-day internationals and two T20Is. – @ZililoR
