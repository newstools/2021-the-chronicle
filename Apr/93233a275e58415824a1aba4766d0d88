None of the students pay school fees and there is no benefactor covering their fees yet. Though we ask some of the students who can afford to contribute towards the Wifi, but still it’s a struggle. “That said, we are glad to have Honourable Raj Modi, he gave us a building to use. He covers all electricity and water bills. However we are still in the process of getting other partners who can also help and we are hoping it is going to be successful,” said Mr Siziba. <img class="wp-image-544138 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/A-young-boy-undergoing-digital-training-at-Salcon-Tech-Hub2-33.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/A-young-boy-undergoing-digital-training-at-Salcon-Tech-Hub2-33.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/A-young-boy-undergoing-digital-training-at-Salcon-Tech-Hub2-33-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A young boy undergoing digital training at Salcon Tech Hub Salcon Tech Hub has begun seeing the benefits of its work as it has rendered services to a number of companies in Bulawayo. Mr Siziba said: “We have companies such as Value gas, Bellevue pharmacy, the Mujiche chain stores and Nashua, they have assisted a lot and we offered our skills to them and received good rewards which help us through our days. “But above all our needs, what we want the most is Wifi and computers. We would like to also thank and appreciate our Raj Modi for the tremendous support he has shown towards us. God has been using him mightily. We call for helpers who are willing to work with us to up skill our people.” Salcon Tech Hub will host its first graduation ceremony on 15 May at Reynolds Inn Hotel. “We haven’t yet had any graduation, but our first graduation will be in May. We have over 450 students, or can as well call them partners, that have upgraded to more levels and we are anticipate their graduation this year. We have over 68 children below the age of 12 and over 240 adults. We are still enrolling as we do train all day long,” he said. Mr Hope Sendamai, the Bulawayo South Constituency manager said training is free for residents of Bulawayo South Constituency. “Cde Modi is the patron and he has made the programme free to the Bulawayo South community. He caters for the operational costs of the project. There will be a graduation in May and the youngest graduate is seven years old,” said Mr Sendamai.
