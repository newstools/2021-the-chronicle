A POOR net run rate could deny Tuskers a chance of ending the 2020/21 domestic cricket season with two trophies as victory by Southern Rocks and Rhinos will see the duo facing off in the final of the Pro50 Championship. Rocks, the 2020/21 Logan Cup champions, currently sit second on the log with 20 points from three matches and face Eagles in their last group match at Old Hararians today while third-placed Rhinos, also on 20 points, lock horns with Mountaineers at Takashinga. Tuskers shot to the top of the five-team table on Saturday following their two-wicket win against Rocks. The Bulawayo side, which won the T20 title, will be praying that either Eagles or Mountaineers spring a surprise by winning one of today’s ties so that Tuskers advance to the final that will be played on Wednesday at Takashinga. Rocks and Rhinos have a superior net run rate compared to Tuskers’ -0.095. Rocks’ net run rate heading into today’s encounter is 1.062, while Rhinos’ stands at 0.459, meaning a win for both sides guarantees them final slots while Tuskers will then head into a third-place playoff.
