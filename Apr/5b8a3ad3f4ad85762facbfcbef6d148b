The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter MORE than 130 primary and secondary schools as well as rural health facilities in Lupane got a shot in the arm after World Vision Zimbabwe donated health and learning materials worth US$63 000. The gesture comes after realization that Lupane schools are some of the worst performing in the province with some recording zero pass rates especially for Grade Seven examinations. World Vision distributed the materials in Lupane recently. <img class="alignnone wp-image-541902 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Lupane-schools-donation-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Lupane-schools-donation-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Lupane-schools-donation-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lupane primary, Mtshibini, Ndlovu, AMR, Kusile, Shabula, Zinaphi, Kabela, Somhlanga, Mtshakabhandana, Komba, Phunyuka, Manasa, Malunku, Kwesemvubu, Sibombo, Kana, Msewele, Sinqobile, Mzola 5, Mzola 27, Thokozani, Ntuthuko, Kana 6, BH42, Nono, Dandanda, Gegema, Sefula, Mahlalufikile, Kanyandavu, Chitete, Makulubuse, Mzola 52, Mzola 55 and Matshokotsha are some of the benefiting primary schools that have benefited so far.

World Vision programmes manager for Lupane district Mrs Sibongumusa Masuku-Ncube said the programme also includes construction of classroom blocks and water and sanitation projects. <img class="alignnone wp-image-541903 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Lupane-clinics-donation.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Lupane-clinics-donation.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Lupane-clinics-donation-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> She said some schools and clinics are benefiting through drilling of boreholes and connection of piped water. “World Vision international currently has two long term programmes and two short term grant funded projects covering a total of 132 schools in the district. To help schools in the district to fulfil demands and realize the goals of the new competence-based education curriculum “In total US$63 000 was set aside for the materials that were distributed. This support was planned within the 2021 budgets to support the prevention and spread of Covid-19 within communities, schools, and health centres as well as support the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education catch-up strategy having realized that children missed schooling for many months due to Covid-19 especially the Grade Sevens who will be sitting for examinations,” said Mrs Masuku-Ncube. She said materials include stationary such as textbooks, early child development learning materials, library books to inculcate a culture of reading and medical supplies and valued at US$63 000. The projects are done through community engagement and participation. World Vision also works with other partners such as IGATE and ProFuturo to capacitate schools and the community at large. The organisation, which is visible all over the world, started operating in Zimbabwe in 1973 and its programmes include relief and development projects designed to address needs of communities especially children, benefiting more than two million people each year. The idea is to enhance education and life skills, support water and sanitation, health and nutrition as well as improve schools’ results. <img class="alignnone wp-image-541905 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Lupane-clinics-and-schools-donation-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Lupane-clinics-and-schools-donation-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Lupane-clinics-and-schools-donation-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Mabhikwa of Lupane said the gesture is a welcome development as it will go a long way in developing the district. “I am aware of the developments in the district. On behalf of community this is a welcome development as it will help learners. Children were finding it difficult to learn because libraries have no books while parents were hard hit by Covid-19,” said chief Mabhikwa. “It is our belief this will improve results considering most of our schools had low pass rates hence we hope all stakeholders including teachers, children and parents will work together.” He said some schools were also getting solar equipment in an effort to promote e-learning. -@ncubeleon
