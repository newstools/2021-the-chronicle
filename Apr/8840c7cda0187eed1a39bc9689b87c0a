THE rise in Covid-19 cases has led to the indefinite suspension of schools’ sports. Health officials descended on Mzilikazi Primary School in Bulawayo on Tuesday to conduct Covid-19 tests for all 800 pupils after eight teachers tested positive two weeks ago. Health officials have also started contact tracing following the Covid-19 cases recorded at the school. A number of schools have recorded Covid-19 cases, with Embakwe High School in Mangwe District, Matabeleland South, recording 91 cases by last Saturday. At Sacred Heart Primary and High schools in Esigodini, more 200 Covid-19 cases were recorded recently. A fortnight ago, Vice-President and Minister of Health and Child Care Dr Constantino Chiwenga implored Zimbabweans to remain vigilant and protect themselves from new Covid-19 infections, which are manifesting in new variants. Last month, the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) said the ball was in the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education’s court for sports to resume in schools. The SRC said it had given schools the green light to restart activities. The National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) and National Association of Primary School Heads (Naph) crafted a comprehensive plan to try and convince the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to allow sports to resume in schools. After consulting the Health and Child Care Ministry, the Primary and Secondary Education Ministry was informed no sport could resume in schools. “Given the threats of a third wave corona variants and that there are no vaccines for children, we advise that schools refrain from sporting activities until the country achieves verifiable herd immunity,” reads part of the Ministry of Health and Child Care’s response to the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education’s inquiry.
