The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter INTERNATIONAL tourist arrivals declined by 87 percent in January this year compared to 2020 on the back of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). The deadly disease was first detected in China in December 2019 and has spread across the globe, posing adverse health and economic implications. In a latest statement, UNWTO has called for stronger co-ordination to restart tourism in all regions across the globe. “The devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on global tourism has carried on into 2021, with new data showing an 87 percent fall in international tourist arrivals in January as compared to 2020,” it said. “The outlook for the rest of the year remains cautious as the UNWTO continues to call for stronger coordination on travel protocols between countries to ensure the safe restart of tourism and avoid another year of massive losses for the sector,” it said. Following a difficult end to 2020, global tourism suffered further setbacks in the beginning of the year as countries tightened travel restrictions in response to new virus outbreaks. – @okazunga
