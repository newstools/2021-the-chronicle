The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter Exactly 491 and 400 days since Dynamos and Highlanders respectively last played competitive football, the two traditional giants of the domestic game collide on Sunday afternoon in the Independence Cup final at the National Sports Stadium. Coincidentally both sides lost their last matches, with DeMbare going down 0-1 to Triangle on December 14, 2019, in their last league game of the season, while Bosso were humbled 0-2 by FC Platinum on March 14, 2020, in a Castle Challenge Cup final at Barbourfields Stadium. The Castle Challenge Cup was meant to be the 2020 Premier Soccer League season opener, but a few days after that match, the country went into total lockdown following an outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. There has been no football since then and the country is set to witness the first ball rolling in local football in more than 12 months at 3pm on Sunday. Coaches Tonderayi Ndiraya for Dynamos and Mandla ‘Lulu’ Mpofu for Highlanders will be praying for an injury-free encounter. “I am excited after a long spell out that we got the green light to resume. An exciting tie again considering the history of the two teams, but one concern is the preparation period that we had for this game. The players are in very bad shape, l hope we won’t get any serious injury,” said  Mpofu,  on Sunday morning. Ndiraya and Mpofu are the national Under-23 head and assistant coaches respectively, while On the Ball sports apparel through their Looks brand are the two teams’ kit sponsors. Today’s winner gets US$20 000 and losers US$15 000. Both teams have won the Independence Cup eight times.
