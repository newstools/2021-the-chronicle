FIVE Bulawayo swimmers left the country on Sunday to compete in the South African Junior Nationals that start today and end on Sunday in Gqeberha (formerly Port Elizabeth). Tichatonga Makaya, Khaya Vimba, Andile Mhlophe, Onesimus Ngwenya and Jayden Deswardt will be aiming for podium finishes in the South African meet. Bulawayo Amateur Swimming Association (BASA) said besides the five, who qualified for the South African competitions in last week’s gala held at the City Pool, Quintin Tayali and Brett Jones also made it for the South African Senior Nationals. “Bulawayo swimmers had a good send off today at the Bulawayo City Pool. We have five swimmers who qualified for South African Junior Nationals to be held in Port Elizabeth from the 14th to the 18th of April 2021. We wish our swimmers all the best as they head to South Africa,” said BASA. Celebrated swimmer Andrescious Cyprianos was named team coach, while Phawulani Ngwenya travelled as manager. Local swimmers have always used South African competitions to measure their competitiveness, earn points and to qualify for international tournaments. — @ZililoR
