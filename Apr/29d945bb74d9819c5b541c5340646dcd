The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE senior national cricket team all-rounder Sikandar Raza has revealed that he has been cleared of cancer and a possible tumour on his right arm. Raza underwent an emergency biopsy after the discovery of a tumour in his arm just after Zimbabwe’s recent series against Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi. Doctors discovered a growth in his bone which was feared could be a tumour or some sort of cancer. However, Raza has since shared the good news on social media. “I want to thank you all for your prayers. The prayers certainly were answered and I’ve been cleared of a tumor and cancer, which is nothing short of a miracle. I am short of words to express and show how grateful I am to you all for your prayers,” said Raza.
