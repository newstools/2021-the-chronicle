GERMANY based model Marble Nyathi who was named the Most Beautiful Model in Düsseldorf this past week says this means a lot to her as she is in the European country to redefine what beauty is. It was a double celebration as she received the Best International Model gong duringthe Zimbabwe Models Awards. Marble, who is a former Miss Zimbabwe and Miss Carnival finalist, said words cannot describe how she feels about being recognised in Zimbabwe. “It’s absolutely undoubtedly humbling. I find no words so perfectly describe how I feel. “I’m very much delighted, for this for me is personal in so many dimensions. Those that have walked with me through my journey understand it very well. I came to redefine beauty not only for myself but for every woman,” said Marble. She said the award in Germany is one that she will cherish as she works for a brand that promotes African designers. “People are chosen through the modelling work they have done, you present your portfolio/profile. “Then people have to vote on who has the best profile. On my profile I’m starting an online shop that would present all African talented designers, I’ve got the opportunity to work with Nigerian women, who have produced blazers that would be displayed on this online shop for people to buy. I’m also working with a South Africa designer who is making handmade bikinis. Half of the sales would be sent as charity to children’s homes in Africa. The idea is to send as many as possible to different children’s homes,” said Marble. Marble won the Europe Best Top Model award in 2019 and has been working with well-known artists, designers and stylists ever since.
