Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa earlier this week said the Independence Virtual Gala is a chance for Zimbabweans to enjoy Independence in the comfort of their homes. “The virtual concert which will be held on the eve of the Independence Day will avail citizens an opportunity to make merry, while in the safe confines of their homes. The welfare of the artists is of paramount importance hence only 50 people will be at the venue. “The police will ensure that only crew and artists will have access to the venue. Further to this, preventative and precautionary Covid-19 protocols will be observed throughout including sanitisation of equipment, frequent hand washing, wearing of masks and social distancing,” said Minister Mutsvangwa.
