THE second edition of the three-day Women in Arts (WIA) Indaba meant to uplift African women in arts is set to be held virtually next month. The event which saw its inaugural edition also being held virtually in December last year, will once again be held on Zoom, Facebook and Star FM under the theme: “Together against corruption and exploitation of women in the arts sector”. A brainchild of fast-rising online news site, Bulawayo Arts News Online (Bano), this year’s event will feature speakers from Italy, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Bano director, Mkhokheli Arts Zibengwi said they are working with Yetin Trust, Winya Sounds, Star FM, Gandary Visions, I’n Designs and Home of Arts among other organisations to address challenges faced by women in the music sector. Performances at the fete will be from songstresses Helen Nyati, Mandie Mae and Lady EFF with guest presenters including Zimbabweans; Kessia Masona, Vuyo Brown, Novuyo Seagirl and Samantha Tshuma. Other guests are South African Adwoa Marvjs and Italian Amos Princiess. <img class="wp-image-543729 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/women-in-arts-pik1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/women-in-arts-pik1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/women-in-arts-pik1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Samantha Tshuma “The workshop is aimed at fighting against corruption and exploitation of women in the arts sector. WIA Indaba will host different women from different parts of the world and different art spheres who will speak about issues affecting them. Through this platform, they will try and come up with possible solutions to the challenges they face,” said Zibengwi. “Because of Covid-19 regulations, this year’s workshop will be hosted virtually with the guest of honour being National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) Bulawayo provincial arts manager, Mrs Cleopatra Dube,” he said. -@mthabisi_mthire.
