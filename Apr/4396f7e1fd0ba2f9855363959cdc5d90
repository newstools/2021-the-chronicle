Zimbabwe’s 41st Independence anniversary will be celebrated differently with a line-up of festivities to be held virtually in accordance with Covid-19 prevention regulations. This year’s theme is “Zim @41 Together, Growing the Economy for a Prosperous, Resilient and Inclusive Society.” Last year the Government resolved that Independence Day celebrations and other key national events will be held in rotation around the country’s 10 provinces. In the wake of Covid-19 however, the Government shelved the celebrations. Announcing a number of events leading to Independence Day on Sunday, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa yesterday said President Mnangagwa will on the day, address the nation virtually. “The President will address the nation at 1130hrs on the 18th of April 2021.This will be live on TV, all national radio stations and on online platforms. There will be repeats later on both radio and TV,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. In the afternoon on Independence Day, Minister Mutsvangwa said Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga will be the guest of honour as Zimbabwe football giants Highlanders FC and Dynamos FC lock horns for the Independence Trophy at the National Sports Stadium. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, no fans will be permitted into the stadium and Zimbabweans will watch the clash of the giants live on ZTV. “Dynamos and Highlanders will battle it out for honours of the Independence Trophy on 18 April 13:00hrs. The event will be closed to the general public and once again only 50 officials and team members will be allowed. “The Independence Trophy will be presented by Hon VP Dr CGDN Chiwenga, who will be the guest of honour. Once again ZBC TV and radio will cover the event live,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. <img class="wp-image-532662 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Minister-Monica-Mutsvangwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Minister-Monica-Mutsvangwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Minister-Monica-Mutsvangwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Monica Mutsvangwa On Independence eve, Minister Mutsvangwa said the President’s wide-ranging interview will be televised on ZTV and ZTN. “His Excellency, the President has given a wide-ranging Interview to State Media.
