BULAWAYO-based school of arts for children, Infinity School of Arts is working on their debut album that is due to be released in June. The school which focuses on children aged between five and 14 years teaches them dance, music, theatre and life skills with the forthcoming 10-track album titled Infinity Child being a result of what they’ve learnt. Infinity School of Arts founder, Newman Finder, said the album seeks to introduce the youngsters to the real world. “We are producing this album because the kids want to tell their own stories through dance. So far, we have managed to come up with tracks We Rise, Bawo Bawo, Sweet Mama, Bulawayo, We came from Makokoba and Usana lwami while the other four tracks are still under production,” Finder said. He said the vocalists comprise Michelle Zulu, Faith Masuku, Holy Gondwe, Nothando Bhunu, Zinhle Moyo, Muffen Gondwe, Jacob Bhunu, Kelvin Nkomazana, Tafara Madzonga and Dean Smango. “We also have professional artistes like Lights out wakoBulawayo, Nicky and Mandy SB featuring on this project.” Star dancer of the group, Gondwe said they were hit hard by the lockdown as some of their members left. He said they are now slowly reassembling the finest team. “Lockdown made us lose so many children but we’re now working on coming up with a great team from scratch,” said Gondwe. He said it is the group’s wish to work with Ama2K President, Tebza and house sensation Novuyo Seagirl as they are inspirations to the group’s members. “We wish to work with Tebza and Novuyo Seagirl in the future as we mature as a group. “We’re also in need of sponsors who will fund the music project in order for it to be a success through its forthcoming launch. We’re therefore appealing to those who are able to assist us to come through,” pleaded Gondwe. -@mthabisi_mthire.
