Shot by Zizo Motion Pictures, Siziba said the visuals open up on his wounds which he did not publicise for years. “The song Pikinini, which is a “Silaphalapha” speaking, meaning a small boy, is a narration about my life some years ago between early 1999 and 2000. “This was a time when I was working in another white lady’s house in Bellevue and it’s a true story,” he said. “I was working as a garden boy and I was treated badly. This hurt me because I had no shoulder to cry on. I remained there as I needed the money but I later quit,” said Siziba. He said with the song, he hopes people will be able to open up on their challenges and face them head on. – @mthabisi_mthire
