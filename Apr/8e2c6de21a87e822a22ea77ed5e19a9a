The Chronicle Former Formula 1 world champion Nico Rosberg says sport must embrace purpose, and that F1 needs to do more. Rosberg, 35, believes football should promote important issues, such as sustainability, with F1 focusing on synthetic fuels. The German has a team in the Extreme E climate-aware racing series, set to begin on Saturday in Saudi Arabia. “With RXR I hope to inspire the sports world to embrace purpose much more strongly,” he said. “Take the European Championships for soccer — I think we should hope to inspire a championship like that to put purpose at its core, to use the reach they have to raise awareness for climate change,” he added. And Rosberg wants his former sport F1 to take the lead in sustainability as well as Extreme E. “F1 doesn’t have great purpose yet — motorsport needs to position itself as having great purpose for mankind.
“ That race-to-road tech transfer helps. Formula 1 can do better and they are working on it. Synthetic fuels, for example — if they take charge of that space and really innovate, it can benefit millions of people around the world. “But F1 has done a lot already with light materials and hybrid engines, which is the most efficient engine in world.” — BBC Sport
