Highlanders will not take their vice-captain Peter Muduhwa for counselling following the abrupt termination of his contract by Tanzanian side Simba SC. Muduhwa’s six-month loan to the Caf Champions League quarter-finalists was cut short under unclear circumstances, but believed to be linked to rivalry between player intermediaries George Deda and Gibson Mahachi. Muduhwa returned home this week without kicking a ball for Simba SC and was never allocated a jersey number. “There is no such thought yet. Currently, the club has been busy with Covid-19 and medical tests in preparation for the coming season. The club was in constant communication with him to offer psychological and mental support to deal with the situation that was coming. Now that he is here, the team’s medical department will look after him should there be any need,” said Highlanders spokesperson Ronald Moyo. Meanwhile, Bosso are expected to complete assembling their 2021 squad today with the signing of two more players, who include a goalkeeper and a striker. Bosso started their pre-season preparations this week and will collide with bitter rivals Dynamos in the Independence Cup final at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday. Although head coach Mandla ‘Lulu’ Mpofu would have wanted better preparations for such an encounter, it’s a known fact that Bosso followers will have none of it if results don’t go their way on Sunday. New club chairman Johnfat Sibanda reportedly told the coaches that losing to Dynamos in whatever occasion was not acceptable.
