For example, I would love to see an Indian visual arts exhibition being hosted here at the gallery,” he said. The Indian Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Mr Khanduja revealed that the embassy was organising a series of cultural events in the country to mark the occasion of their 75th independence anniversary. “We started the programmes in March 2021 with the celebration of Holi, the festival of colours. One sees vibrancy of colours in Indian paintings. “The cultural events will showcase several Indian art forms including classical dance forms like Kuchipudi, Bharatnatyam, Mohiniattam and Kathakali which have proponents all over the world,” said Mr Khanduja. Receiving his award, Nama legend, Nkululeko Innocent Dube who is the founder and director of Iyasa thanked NACZ and its sponsors for honouring the legends with deserved recognition for their different crafts. Dube said the recognition of legends while they were still alive was significant in that it could inspire others to seek similar acknowledgement. “Honouring our own while they can still hear us, smell the roses and feel the appreciation. May it not only be at funerals that we tell each other’s corpses, graves and golden caskets that our work was or is appreciated,” Dube said.
