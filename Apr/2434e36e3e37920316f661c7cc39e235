PREMIER Soccer League returnees Bulawayo City FC have taken over the running of Crescent Sports Club and intend to open offices, a training venue and sports bar to generate revenue. Amakhosi, as City are known, will pay US$250 per month for the facility along Harare Road behind Hartsfield Rugby Ground, according to the latest city council minutes. “The acting director of town planning recalled (March 1, 2021) that council (July 12, 2016) had resolved to lease out Phekiwe Beer Garden to Bulawayo City Football club for the establishment of a western area clubhouse for an initial period of two years subject to review. The lease had since expired. Furthermore, council (July 3, 2019) had resolved to repossess stand number 11828BT from Crescent Sports Club and that the sports club be tendered in the usual manner. “However, the department was in possession of two application letters to lease out stand number 11828BT (former Crescent Sports Club) and cease out Phekiwe Beer Garden lease from Bulawayo City Football Club,” read the latest council minutes. “We have identified Crescent Sports Club as an ideal facility, conveniently located to meet our needs which are offices, training ground and income generating project through running a sports bar,” reads the application by Amakhosi. The letter further stated that should the application succeed, the lease agreement for Phekiwe Beer Garden should be cancelled. The council department had no objection to the application and recommended a monthly rental of US$250 or equivalent in Zimbabwe currency excluding VAT. The lease shall be for an initial period of five years.
