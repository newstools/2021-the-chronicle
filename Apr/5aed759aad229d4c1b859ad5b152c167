POLICE in Gwanda, Matabeleland South province have launched an operation code named “Operation uyi-bottle store na?” which seeks to close down nightclubs that are flouting the lockdown regulations. This comes after some nightclubs reopened in violation of lockdown regulations. Most of the nightclubs have taken advantage of Cabinet’s relaxation of Covid-19 lockdown regulations allowing restaurants sit-in customers to reopen. Some of the nightclubs are open until the wee hours of the morning. Matabeleland South police provincial spokesperson Inspector Loveness Mangena said: “We launched the “Operation uyi-bottle store na?”on 27 March and we have so far arrested six nightclub operators for violating the lockdown regulations. “The nightclubs found operating illegally are Manzamnyama night club, Village bar, Ultra-Light Bar, View ward bar, Phoenix Pub and Grill and Limelight Talk of Gwanda,” said Insp Mangena. She said the arrested nightclub operators paid a fine of $500 each and if they commit the offence for the third time they will be dragged to the courts. She called on nightclub operators and bottle stores that have been allowed to open to comply with the lockdown regulations. “There should be no sit-in at bottle stores and as police we will be out in full force to ensure the lockdown regulations are strictly adhered to,” said Insp Mangena. Chronicle observed that a number of bottle stores continue to be defiant as they serve sit-in customers while nightclubs have illegally opened. Bar operators from the western suburbs were using back doors to serve customers while others locked their patrons in. — @mthabisi_mthire.
