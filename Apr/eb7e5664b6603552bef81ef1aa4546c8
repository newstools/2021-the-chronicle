PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has congratulated South Africa for attaining 27 years of freedom from apartheid, a system which exposed black people to many injustices such as poor education, cheap labour and discrimination. South Africa yesterday celebrated Freedom Day, the day that commemorates the country’s first non-racial democratic elections in 1994 which marked the end of apartheid. The elections marked the advent of democracy after nearly four centuries of colonialism and apartheid. Posting on his official Twitter page yesterday, President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe stands with all South Africans in remembering their liberation stalwarts. “Happy #FreedomDay! Zimbabwe stands with all South Africans in remembering those who fought for freedom,” he said. Zimbabwe and South Africa enjoy cordial relations dating back to the liberation struggle. South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa led the main celebration at Botshabelo in Free State province under the theme: “The year of Charlotte Maxeke — the meaning of freedom under COVID-19.” Maxeke led a campaign of resistance against the pass laws in 1913 in Free State. The province is also the birthplace of the African National Congress. It was also in Free State that the historic African claims document was adopted in 1943, setting out the demands of South African people for the realisation of their rights. — @mashnets
