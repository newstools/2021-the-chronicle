The Chronicle Harare bureau President Mnangagwa has left for Maputo to attend an SADC Extraordinary Double Troika Summit on the security situation in northern Mozambique. He was seen off at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport by Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga, Service Chiefs and senior Government officials.

The Double Troika is made up of Mozambique, the current SADC chair; Malawi (incoming chair) and the United Republic of Tanzania (immediate previous chair). Other members include countries that constitute the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation – Botswana (current chair), South Africa (incoming) and Zimbabwe (outgoing).
