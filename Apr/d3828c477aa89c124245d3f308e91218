BULAWAYO Athletics Board (BAB) will stage its Track and Field Open Championship at White City Stadium, as athletics gradually returns after easing of the Covid-19 enforced lockdown. BAB chairperson Watson Madanyika said all work had been done to ensure the event is smooth sailing. “All our focus is on staging a successful event on Saturday. The programme for the day is already in place and registration is in progress online until Thursday (today). Entry fees are US$1 or equivalent in local currency for juniors. For the seniors it’s US$2. We are expecting over 100 athletes to take part in this competition. Athletes from clubs from other provinces have confirmed their participation. We are looking forward to a good competition,” said Madanyika. He emphasised that the event will be held under strict Covid-19 prevention protocols. “We will use one entrance and all athletes and supporting staff will be recorded upon entry. No spectators will be allowed,” he said. This event is not on the calendar, but Madanyika said they had drafted it in so that athletes participate in as many competitions as they can to get back into shape. Events on offer will be the 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1 500m and 5 000m races. For the field events, participants will take part in the long jump, triple jump and discus. There will be no relays. — @innocentskizoe
