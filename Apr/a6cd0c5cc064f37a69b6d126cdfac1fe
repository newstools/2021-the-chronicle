The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent BUDDING poet, Kokesto Nyathi who hails from rural Gwanda South district has started penning a book titled Under The Meslow which seeks to encourage more scientific research towards diseases that mostly lead up to pandemics. The world has in the past century been faced with the HIV pandemic and recently Covid-19 that has claimed thousands of lives in the country and worldwide. The 20-year-old poet said she hopes the book will increase awareness on the consistent need to research for possible diseases cures. “I’m working on my book which will be published first under The Meslow. It’s vampirism fiction which is aimed at teaching more about scientific research and the possibility of the United Nations and Africa working together in search of cures for different diseases. “The book reveals how the world was devastated by the sudden emergence of pandemics which forced continents to join hands,” said Nyathi. She said her artistic work is inspired by Tsitsi Dangarembwa, Chengerai Hove, Justine Hardy and her former teacher C.M Gondongwe. The young artist who also writes poems that caution against anti-social behaviours in societies last week released a poem on a young girl who was molested by a pastor, but the society ignored her quest for justice. – @mthabisi_mthire
