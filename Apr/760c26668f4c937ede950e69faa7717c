SEVEN arts groups are set to battle it out at the Geraldine Roche Drama (GRD) competition finals slated for Bulawayo Theatre this Saturday. The competition which is in its third edition, covers Bulawayo, Matabeleland South and North provinces. Two best groups from each province are competing in the finals and these are Jahunda Community Arts and Loxion Theatre from Matabeleland South province, Vulindlela and Pezhuba from Matabeleland North province and Stanslavysky and Colada from Bulawayo. Reigning champions, Bambelela Arts automatically secured a spot in the finals making them the seventh participant. The competition uses drama and film to deliver messages and raise awareness on issues affecting communities while at the same time sharpening drama skills, especially among youths. Geraldine Roche project co-ordinator, Khaliphile Sibanda said preparations for the finals are at an advanced stage. “We’re on track as we’ve managed to select participants for the finals which we hope to host without any hindrances related to Covid-19 issues. The ultimate drive of the competition is to empower arts groups through theatre and drama,” said Sibanda. Last year winners, Bambelela Arts from Bulawayo starred in three plays which were a collaboration between Bulawayo-based GRD and Harare’s Jasen Mphepo Little Theatre. — @mthabisi_mthire.
