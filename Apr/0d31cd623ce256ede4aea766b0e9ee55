Urban Culxure founder, Kudakwashe “Kuda” Takundwa said the move was to ensure women are celebrated for all their hard work and contribution in societies. “This was done as a way to celebrate and have women talk about their success stories and challenges. The interviews impacted the lives of those inspired by these women. This helped to open dialogue on key issues surrounding women in the country and the rest of the world,” said Kuda. <img class="alignnone size-article-featured-image wp-image-539262" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/D4E593A8-0B67-478B-B9FB-9EAB5FC22B4D-297x380.jpeg" alt="" width="297" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/D4E593A8-0B67-478B-B9FB-9EAB5FC22B4D.jpeg 297w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/D4E593A8-0B67-478B-B9FB-9EAB5FC22B4D-281x360.jpeg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /> He said the interactions shed light on the experiences of women and raised awareness on their need to partake in leadership positions. Those who took part in the discussion expressed the need to celebrate women on a daily basis. Award-winning TV content producer, Soneni Gwizi tweeted, “Women need to be celebrated because they are a part of society that adds value to life. Without women, we wouldn’t be here and I mean all women, women with disabilities, and able-bodied women. #SheLeads.” On the technology industry, Vickie Ngono tweeted: “To thrive in this space, support and encouragement are needed because the field is less than welcoming for young women and girls. It’s heart-warming to say I had the needed support from family when I made the decision to pursue a career in #Tech. #Sheleads.” – @mthabisi_mthire
