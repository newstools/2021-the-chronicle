We laughed about it and my creative juices hit me to come up with a song for fun,” he said. “Mzoe 7 heard the song from one of the guys who helped me with keyboards and he showed interest. He insisted that he wanted to be part of the project and I roped him in. As for J_Hack, we met in 2019 when I had a gig in South Africa. Since then, we’d been in touch,” said Mdlongwa. <img class="alignnone wp-image-539519 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/uuu2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/uuu2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/uuu2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said plans are underway to approach Rasquesity of Keaitse Films to shoot the visuals of the single which will be released alongside his upcoming album. – @mthabisi_mthire
