UP-and-coming sungura artiste, DT BiO Mudimba (real name Tawanda Ncube)’s Kujatajata single which he released in December last year is taking the airwaves by storm, putting the artiste’s Tonga mother tongue in the limelight. It only took a month for Kujatajata to gain momentum before it became an instant hit landing on number one on the charts from February to date. The artiste who is the leader of the Kaani Stars troupe, has arguably created history by hanging on the number one position on National FM’s top 20 chart for close to nine weeks. On Radio Zimbabwe, it has gone for consecutive weeks on number one on the Radio Zim OK top 20. The only time it slipped from number one was when it was displaced by Romeo Gasa and Simon Mutambi’s hit songs, Time to dance and Mr Ibu respectively. Kujatajata regained its number one slot at last Saturday’s Radio Zim OK Top 20. Elsewhere on Capitalk Radio and Nyaminyami FM, it has been rocking the charts by clinging on number one for several weeks. Kujatajata is also arguably the first Tonga song to be an instant hit on local radio stations. In an interview, D.T Bio said his new found fame is a culmination of hard work in promoting the Tonga language. “I’m grateful that my works are being appreciated and I am having an impact on our Zimbabwean showbiz,” he said. Interestingly, the song is also being played as far as the US, United Kingdom and South Africa. “I am receiving endorsement deals as far as the US, UK and neighbouring South Africa and these people are saying they heard the song on some of the radio stations in their respective countries,” said D.T Bio.-@joelTsvakwi.
