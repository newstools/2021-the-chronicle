Midlands Provincial Development Coordinator Mr Abiot Maronge confirmed the development in an interview yesterday. The local authorities want to use the money to buy water pumps, equipment to use in fixing roads and procure ICT hardware and software, among others. He said through the disbursement of the money, local authorities have been able to address infrastructure projects in record time. Mr Maronge commended central Government for living up to its promises by releasing the funds to the local authorities in the province. “We are grateful to the Government for the devolution funds which have been allocated to local authorities. “Roads have been rehabilitated, clinics and schools have been built and various service delivery equipment such as refuse trucks, graders, tippers, among others, have been procured,” he said. Mr Maronge said more funds are on their way adding that local authorities are required to acquit received money for them to get more. “More funds are on their way. Meanwhile, a lot of very good work is going on across the province — borehole drilling for example Vungu RDC and Zibagwe RDC on procurement of road making equipment, Mberengwa, Gokwe South and North RDC classroom blocks, health centres, Vungu, Mberengwa, Kwekwe City Council, Shurugwi Town Council water articulation for example,” he said.
