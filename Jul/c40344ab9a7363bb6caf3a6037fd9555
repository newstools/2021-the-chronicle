In March the province received $76 500 000 toward of which $13 500 000 is for quarantine centres while $63 000 000 has been allocated towards isolation centres. “Four quarantine centres are being renovated in the province namely DDF Training Centre in Gwanda, Esikhoveni Training Centre in Esigodini, Pangani Vocational Training Centre in Filabusi and Matobo Research Station in Matobo. Two other quarantine centres were scheduled for renovation namely Thuli Training Centre in Gwanda and Avoca Vocational Training in Mangwe but they didn’t receive funding.
