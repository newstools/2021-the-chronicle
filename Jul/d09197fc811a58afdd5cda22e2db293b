The Chronicle KHAMA Billiat says he knows ‘how great the feeling can be’ to win the Caf Champions League and is determined to feel it again this weekend. Kaizer Chiefs take on Al Ahly in a massively awaited encounter at the Mohamed V Stadium tomorrow. It has been an incredible journey for Chiefs and Billiat after a problematic domestic campaign, with the opportunity of some silverware as an actual motivating factor. The 30-year-old Zimbabwe international won the Caf Champions League final with Mamelodi Sundowns in 2016 and is eager to get his hands on the trophy this term. He told KickOff: “The guys really did well to be where we are right now, it’s a great experience, and it’s a blessing to be part of the team at the moment; it’s a lifetime experience that any other player would want to be in the (same) situation. “It requires a lot of hard work and to be mentally strong knowing that it’s no longer domestic, we meet the best of Africa and competing for a big trophy, you know. I would say give credit to everyone who’s been part of this journey.’’ Billiat added: “I’ve had this journey before, and I know how difficult it is, I know how great the feeling can be at the end, so it’s a movie that has happened before, so I’m glad to be where I am right now and looking forward to going all the way with the team and have great memories with this great club, I’m at.’’ — News24.com
