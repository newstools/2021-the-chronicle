GOSPEL musician Christopher Nkomazana who uses the stage name Makhosi Nkomazana is a man out to promote Catholic music through his second album titled Ngangingedwa. The eight-track album that was produced by Neshville features artistes Freddy Ndlovu, Gazelimnyama, Indosakusa’s Oscar Siziba Thobela and Sunduza Dance Theatre’s Ntando Sithole. The album that was released recently is a follow up to his debut, Sengibuyela Kuwe which was produced by the late legendary producer Joe Maseko and dedicated to his late Father Alois Nkomazana and brother Father Peter Nkomazana. Makhosi Nkomazana said the latest offering which borrows a lot from Catholic music, seeks to promote Catholic music. “I penned eight songs after doing a lot of research for over three years. Through this album and my music in general, I’m hoping to be a messenger of God’s word. I know that’s an uphill task but where there’s a will, there’s a way,” Makhosi Nkomazana said. He said he was working on buying his instruments and also establishing his own studio before the end of this year. “I owe my success to my family, priests at Luveve Catholic Church, people from Gwabalanda and Luveve, fellow musicians and above all, the Marianhill Community International because I am who I am because of their nurturing,” said Makhosi Nkomazana. His first music video for the song Ngizidelile has been released with the artiste encouraged by its views on YouTube that have surpassed 1 000.
