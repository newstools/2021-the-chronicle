ZIMBABWE tennis sensation Kudzai Chapepa (13) will be hoping for better fortunes in the J5 ITF Nairobi Junior Open Two that gets underway on Monday. The tourney is an ITF under-18 competition where the players, among other things, target improving their international rankings. The first-leg of the competition took place last week and Chapepa lost 1-6, 1-6 to South African Marilouise in the first round of the competition. Having raked in her first ITF junior ranking points on home soil last month, Chapepa will be hoping to get more points in Nairobi. Her coach Thesly Mafunda said: “The key is to let her adapt to this new level, but she has the passion and a high work ethic that I believe will drive her to want to achieve more. There are actually other competitions set for Kenya but she will only take part in two of them.” Chapepa went into the first J5 ITF Juniors seeded 18th in the main draw. This is her first ITF tourney as a seeded player. Another Zimbabwean in the competition is Rufaro Magarira, who lost in the final of the first-leg 3-6, 4-6 to American Cleo Hutchinson. – @innocentskizoe
