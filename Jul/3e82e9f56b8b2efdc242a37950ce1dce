The country continues to lose a lot of revenue due to goods that are being smuggled into the country. With borders only open for commercial purposes and returning residents many are now illegally bringing goods into the country through illegal entry points. Police have intensified patrols along the border lines as part of efforts to curb smuggling and border jumping crimes which are on the increase. – @DubeMatutu
