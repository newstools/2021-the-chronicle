THE Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) says its regional integration programmes have picked pace despite the negative effects of the Covid-19 pandemic due to adoption of technology by member States. According to a recent performance update by the Comesa secretariat, there has been an upward trajectory in programme activities in the second quarter of the year as restrictions on movement of people in the region eases. “These have been made possible through the adoption and application of Information, Communication Technologies (ICTs), which have built the organisation’s resilience to implement its programmes. “Amidst the prevailing Covid-19 situation, the implementation of the Comesa regional integration programmes has picked pace, with a notable consistent budget absorption under member States funding on operational expenditures,” said the 21-member trading bloc in which Zimbabwe, Zambia, Lesotho, Swaziland and Rwanda are part of.  – @okazunga
