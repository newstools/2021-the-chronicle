Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) Bulawayo provincial secretary/general Loviniah Bhebhe has resigned with immediate effect, a month after her controversial suspension. According to her letter of resignation addressed to provincial chairperson Joseph Nkomazana and copied to the Zina national executive, Bhebhe said she took the decision to step down “as a result of her media influenced suspension by Nkomazana”. Bhebhe was suspended last month by Nkomazana over an Africa Day netball tournament held at Sobukhazi High School that saw teams flouting Covid-19 health guidelines. Her suspension, however, was riddled with controversy after sources said she had been suspected of working with the breakaway Rainbow Amateur Netball League (Ranl). “It is with great honour and respect that I tender this resignation letter from the position of interim-secretary general I held in your organisation. It is with regret that my departure is unceremonious as a result of the media influenced suspension that your office initiated. It was nice and very educative to be under your quality leadership and I will forever cherish and would like to wish you all the best in identifying, educating, training and evaluating the girl child through netball into modern professional players. I wish you all the best as an executive,” wrote Bhebhe in her letter gleaned by Chronicle Sport.
