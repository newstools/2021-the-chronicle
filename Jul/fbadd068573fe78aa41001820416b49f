The Chronicle England fans erupted in joy last night as the national team qualified for a first major final in more than half a century. Jubilant supporters took to the streets across the country after Harry Kane’s extra-time goal secured a place in the Euro 2020 final. In London fans climbed onto the top of buses as they partied late into the night after Gareth Southgate’s men won 2-1 against Denmark. In pubs and fan zones, supporters lobbed several of the estimated 10 million pints bought last night into the air in celebration – while others removed their shirts, embraced strangers, or simply wept. There was mayhem when the final whistle blew, with the result setting up a crunch last with Italy on Sunday night. Supporters in the fan zone in Trafalgar Square were sent into raptures as the England skipper netted despite initially missing a spot kick. Many also sang, and it was no surprise the anthemic Three Lions and its familiar “It’s coming home” refrain reverberated around the country at the final whistle. Fans released red-coloured smoke and sang as they swarmed out of the stadium following England’s win. Addi Hassan, 21, described the win as “absolutely incredible, absolutely world class”. Peter Lewis, 18, from Richmond, south-west London, said: “Oh my word, I can’t believe it! When he missed there was a split second where I thought ‘it’s not going to happen’. “What a captain, what a leader, he followed it up and smashed it home.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-556577 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Celebration-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Celebration-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Celebration-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The majority of the 60,000 fans inside the stadium roared as players embraced at the end of a gruelling extra-time period. The anthemic Three Lions and its familiar “It’s coming home” refrain reverberated around Wembley at the final whistle. After the match jubilant fans released red-coloured smoke and sang as they swarmed out of the stadium. England fans Scarlet Devereux and Lucy Millard, both 18, were elated as they left Wembley. Ms Devereux said: “It was a brilliant game, the atmosphere was absolutely amazing.” Ms Millard added: “It’s the first time in so many years we’ve been in the semi-finals so it’s absolutely amazing. It’s coming home.” Many fans tried to stay out late to enjoy the win, with a few dozen supporters in Leicester Square climbing on top of a number 9 double-decker bus to Aldwych, cheering and holding a St George’s flag aloft before crowds were broken up by police. Fans in Birmingham dived into canals and paddled around in the water after the final whistle. One supporter even stripped down to his underpants as he danced along to ‘Football’s coming home’. Carnival-like celebrations broke out in Bristol as fans blocked city centre roads in jubilant scenes. Meanwhile crowds let off fireworks in Manchester and gathered in their hundreds in Stevenson Square, throwing a giant inflatable football to each other. It was a game of contrasting emotions for England fans, including inside the stadium, in pubs and fan zones, and those among the estimated 20 million watching on television at home. Supporters in London’s Trafalgar Square were sent into raptures each time England scored, with those in the fan zone roaring loudly, jumping on to the tables and throwing their beers in the air. Chants of “Come on England” and “It’s coming home” became common place. Earlier, the 8,000 UK-based Danes inside Wembley celebrated wildly in the 30th minute as their side took an unlikely lead. Fans in Trafalgar Square were left silent by the Danish opener – the first that England conceded in the tournament – and home supporters could be heard swearing and booing after the ball hit the net. James Little, 19, a student from Sutton, south London, said: “I’m gobsmacked to be honest, we haven’t conceded in this tournament and I feel like the way we play means we need to score first. “It’s a long way back from here, I hope the semi-final curse doesn’t strike again – this is the best chance we have to win.” England were installed as clear favourites among bookmakers to beat Denmark, having progressed through the tournament without conceding a goal. The Danes had emerged from heartbreak in their opening match defeat to Finland – when talisman Christian Eriksen collapsed on the pitch – to make it into the last four. England’s victory means the men’s team will play in their first major final since the 1966 World Cup, which they won. – Mirror Sport
