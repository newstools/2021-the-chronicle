Award-winning rapper Asaph who received a pair of Air Max 98 blood said such synergies with local businesses is what they envisage as artistes.  “Big shout out to the guys for bringing us together and gifting us. Drip (stylish fashion) and hip hop meet like this. So, the more fashion and music interact, the more we make this lifestyle come out in a big way.

Fast-rising RnB musician, Kayla Black who received a pair of Air Max 90 Metallic Gold sneakers said it was a wonderful gesture from True West. “I really want to thank these guys for what they’re doing.
