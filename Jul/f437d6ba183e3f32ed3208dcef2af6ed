THE Zimbabwe women’s rugby national team underwent successful PCR Covid-19 tests ahead of their Rugby Africa Women’s Cup first test match against the Cranes of Uganda on Wednesday afternoon. The team, led by flyhalf Constance Ngwende, all retained negative tests, meaning coach Munya Mhonda has a full squad complement to choose from for the first clash. The two sides will battle it out in the first of two matches in a Pool C match, at Kyadondo Rugby Grounds in Kampala. The two teams collide again four days later for the second encounter at the same venue. The two reverse fixtures will determine who progresses to the next round of the competition, which serves as a World Cup qualifier. As part of preparations for the matches against Uganda, the Zimbabwean women played two friendly matches against their Ugandan counterparts in Harare early last month. As a way of creating a platform for the women’s international teams to compete in more consistent, competitive and sustainable competitions at regional and global level, this year Rugby Africa released a unified calendar for the men’s and women’s 15s version of the game. – @innoceentskizoe
