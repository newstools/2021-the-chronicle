In March, a gang armed with a pistol struck at a Trek fuel station in Gwabalanda suburb and got away with US$15,300 and R800. Three days later, three men armed with a pistol held up petrol attendants at Amakhosi Service Station along the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Road. They tied up a security guard and two petrol attendants.
