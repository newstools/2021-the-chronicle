MATABELELAND South Province has received $76 million to renovate its isolation and quarantine centres. Beitbridge and Plumtree receive high numbers of deportees from South Africa and Botswana resulting in increased demand for quarantine and isolation space. In a report on Covid-19 projects for the year 2020, Matabeleland South Provincial Public Works Director Mr Sijabuliso Ncube said four quarantine centres were being renovated in the province. “Having completed the year 2020 with outstanding works in both isolation and quarantine centres, there is urgent need to complete these projects. In March the province received $76 500 000 of which $13 500 000 is for quarantine centres while $63 000 000 has been allocated towards isolation centres,” he said. The four quarantine centres being renovated in the province are DDF Training Centre in Gwanda, Esikhoveni Training Centre in Esigodini, Pangani Vocational Training Centre in Filabusi and Matobo Research Station in Matobo. Work on Thuli Training Centre in Gwanda and Avoca Vocational Training in Mangwe is yet to start. Mr Ncube said three isolation centres were also being renovated at Gwanda Provincial Hospital, Beitbridge District Hospital and Plumtree District Hospital. He said all the works were expected to have been completed by the end of this month. Mr Ncube said the works being done at isolation centres include installation of Intensive Care Units (ICU) ventilation systems, installation of medical gases and bulk gas storage. He said at the quarantine facilities they were doing plumbing, electrical and painting, carpentry and tiling. “The work is progressing well at all centres,” said Mr Ncube. — @DubeMatutu.
