The Minister urged members of the public to take heed of Government calls to stop boarding mushikashika or pirate taxis. “For now, Intercity travel has been banned and as Government we are saying the public has to observe and comply with Covid-19 protocols and measures to safeguard lives,” he said. Toyota Granvia and Toyota Wish vehicles are notorious for illegally transporting passengers and are a common sight on the country’s highways. The vehicles are usually overloaded with Wish vehicles carrying up to 10 passengers while Granvia vans usually carry around 15 passengers. Illegal transporters have been cashing in on the ban of inter-city buses under the enhanced Level Four Covid-19 control regulations and have been carrying passengers between cities.
