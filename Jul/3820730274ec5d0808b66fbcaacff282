THE Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) is awaiting a response from Rugby Africa on its offer to play host to Pool D Rugby Africa Cup matches after Tunisia pulled out last week citing rising Covid-19 cases in the north African country. Pool D consists of Burkina Faso, Tunisia and Zimbabwe and their matches had been scheduled for July 9-17 in Monastir, but the Tunisia government banned all sporting activities due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Rugby Africa is now looking at ways of protecting the interests of the three teams involved and the final decision will be made soon. ZRU said it had been given the greenlight by the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) to host the event if Rugby Africa agrees. “We got the greenlight from SRC and we have communicated this to Rugby Africa. So, for now we are waiting for their response. We hope to host the matches because it will be to our advantage,” said ZRU vice-president Martin Shone. This year’s Rugby Africa Cup is one of the pathways for the 2023 Rugby World Cup qualification.
If Zimbabwe win Pool D, they will most likely meet Madagascar in the quarter-finals and then Namibia in the last four in July next year. The winner of the Rugby Africa Cup will secure a ticket to the Rugby World Cup in France, while the runners-up also stand a chance of qualifying via the Repechage. SABLES SQUAD
