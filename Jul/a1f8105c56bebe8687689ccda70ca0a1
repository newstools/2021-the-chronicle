THE Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) and Bulawayo Metropolitan Rugby Football Board (BMRFB) have ironed out their long-standing differences, resulting in the latter’s executive committee being reinstated. ZRU dissolved the BMRFB executive in March 2020 ahead of the union’s elective annual general meeting, accusing it of “paralysing the smooth running” of rugby in Bulawayo. The timing of BMRFB’s suspension raised eyebrows, with some individuals involved in the game in Bulawayo accusing ZRU of trying to prevent the province from having a say in the development of rugby in the country.   <img class="wp-image-489861 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/craig-change-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/craig-change-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/craig-change-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Craig Change BMRFB challenged its suspension, but ZRU went ahead and appointed an interim committee to serve for two years. However, ZRU has since rescinded its 2020 decision by reinstating the suspended committee, saying they had taken advantage of the Covid-19 enforced break to reinvigorate by engaging all stakeholders for the development of rugby in all provinces. Aaron Jani, ZRU president, said: “I have high hopes that once the lockdown is over, Bulawayo will once again be the hive of rugby activity.” Reinstated BMRFB chairman Craig Change said his executive is committed to the development of rugby in Bulawayo. “We will work with the union in reviving and developing rugby in the province and the country through fruitful engagements,” said Change. -@ZililoR
