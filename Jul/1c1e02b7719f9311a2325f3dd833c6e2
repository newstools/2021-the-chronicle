The Warriors left for the Cosafa Cup on Monday morning, with late inclusion Dellick Murimba of Triangle United travelling with the team. Harare City midfielder Ben Musaka, who was drafted into the squad after the withdrawal of striker Evans Rusike, Perfect Chikwende and Godknows Murwira due to injury, is expected to join the rest of the squad on Tuesday. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-556025" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In an interview from Johannesburg in transit to the Eastern Cape, Warriors’ general manager Wellington Mpandare said morale was high in camp. “The boys are raring to go. Injuries have forced us to make changes to the squad. We had also called Panashe Mutimbanyoka from FC Platinum as a replacement, but we’ve been told that he’s unavailable as he is in isolation. “Xolani Ndlovu, Bill Antonio and Emmanuel Mandiranga are on standby. With these Covid-19 cases and injuries, we don’t know what might happen and they might be called to join camp anytime,” said Mpandare. Zimbabwe open their campaign against Mozambique on Thursday. <img class="alignnone wp-image-556027 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Warriors-44.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Warriors-44.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Warriors-44-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Warriors will then face Namibia at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on July 11 before they clash with West African guest nation Senegal three days later.
