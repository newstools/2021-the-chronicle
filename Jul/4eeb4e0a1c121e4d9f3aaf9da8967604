The Chronicle A SURPRISE report coming out of Spain claims that Manchester United could be open to the idea of using Paul Pogba in a swap deal for a Real Madrid star. The Red Devils have been linked with Los Blancos defender Raphael Varane for the past few months as his contract situation with the club remains undecided. The French defender is now in the final year of his contract and there is no indication yet that he will sign a new deal, which could force Real to sell now rather than lose him for free. Spanish publication Diario AS claim that United are unwilling to meet Los Blancos’ asking price of €50million but they are prepared to include Pogba as a makeweight. Similarly to Varane, his countryman is now in the final year of his contract with the Red Devils but he continues to be linked with his former club Juventus. Renowned football journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that the Premier League outfit are in contact with Madrid but there has been no official bid yet. “Manchester United are in contact with Real Madrid for Varane. No official bid yet – won’t be a “quick” deal. Red circle #MUFC,” Romano tweeted. “Personal terms won’t be an issue – Real still hope to convince Varane to stay, but he wants to try something new. He’s on top of #MUFC list as CB since months. — KickOff
