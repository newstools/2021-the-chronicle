The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter LOW-COST airline, Fastjet Zimbabwe, has introduced a third Embraer ERJ145 aircraft into commercial service in the country. The 50-seater aircraft that was introduced on the Harare-Bulawayo route touched down at Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport in Bulawayo last Friday with the airline’s board and management, officials from Government, hospitality and aviation sectors as well as passengers on board. Fastjet board chair Advocate Farai Mutamangira said they were optimistic the introduction of the new aircraft would make a huge business impact despite the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are seeing the outlook beyond the pandemic. We are also motivated by the response by the Government to the pandemic. Look at the rate at which we have accelerated the vaccination of our population…the Government has done its part and as the private sector we need to complement that by doing our part,” he said in an interview. The additional aircraft, Embraer ERJ145, offers capabilities that are compatible with the Zimbabwean and South African regional market needs including a comfortable cabin environment, said the company.
