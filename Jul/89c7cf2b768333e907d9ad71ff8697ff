The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent SOCIAL media comedian-cum-actress Madam Boss is on cloud nine after clinching one million followers on her Facebook fan page, becoming the first female comedian in Zimbabwe to reach that benchmark. Having started off as a social media entertainer six years ago, Madam Boss (real name Tarisai Cleopatra Chikoch-Munetsiwa) has grown to become a fully-fledged actress and an influencer of note. <img class="alignnone wp-image-556623 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Madam-Boss-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Madam-Boss-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Madam-Boss-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This year has been a fruitful one for her as she has been scoring numerous deals from corporate endorsements to acting roles across the region. While consistently putting in the work, her brand that has mostly been associated with virtual audiences, has been playing popular among many, something that has been clearly evidenced by the rise in followers online. Chronicle Showbiz caught up with the comedian who said she is humbled to have a million people attached to her brand as it shows that she is doing something right. <img class="alignnone wp-image-556625 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Madam-Boss-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Madam-Boss-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Madam-Boss-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “After six years since the birth of Madam Boss, the character and the brand, we’re now at a million followers on Facebook.
