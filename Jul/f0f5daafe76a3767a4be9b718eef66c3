She said Cabinet has approved establishment of a building technology plant with a proposed shareholding of 51/49 for Shelter Afrique and the Government of Zimbabwe respectively. Also approved was the establishment of a regional office for the SADC region in Harare in which “Government will provide the requisite land”, said the minister.

In May, BancABC, the local banking unit of pan-African financial services group Atlas Mara, concluded an US$11 million housing finance deal with Shelter Afrique. The combined US$11 million housing financing facilities will be deployed towards the development of 2 500 housing units for low- and middle-income groups. The bank has previously collaborated with Shelter Afrique in housing schemes and in 2011 the two concluded a US$7 package for construction of 150 housing units. In 2015, Shelter Africa extended a US$5 million loan facility to BancABC to finance the trade activities of importers and exporters of building materials and equipment.
