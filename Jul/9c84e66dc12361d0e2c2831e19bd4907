THE Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has announced that experienced wicket-keeper batsmen Mushfiqur Rahim will miss the remainder of the Zimbabwe tour due to personal reasons. He is expected to leave Harare for Dhaka on Wednesday. “Bangladesh batsman Mushfiqur Rahim will miss the remainder of the tour in Zimbabwe for family reasons. Mushfiqur will leave Harare later today and travel to Dhaka. He will miss Bangladesh’s three ODIs against Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club on 16, 18 and 20 July and also the three-match T20 international series that starts at the same venue on 23 July,” BCB said. “The Bangladesh Cricket Board requests that all respect the privacy of Mushfiqur and his family at this time.” Bangladesh thrashed Zimbabwe by 220 runs in the only Test played at Harare Sports Club. The two sides will now shift focus to the three-match ODI series that begins on Friday. The three-match ODI series forms part of the ICC Super League, which serves as the main route for qualification for the 2023 edition of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in India. Bangladesh will conclude their tour with T20I matches set for July 23, 25 and 27. -@innocentskizoe
