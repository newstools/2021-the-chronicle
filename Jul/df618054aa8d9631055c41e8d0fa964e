The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Online Reporter BULAWAYO residents are not adhering to the 30-mourners stipulation allowed at cemeteries as part of the Covid-19 regulations, with some using their political affiliation and influence to break the rule, the latest Bulawayo City Council minutes reveal. Last week, Government said funerals are Covid-19 super spreaders and measures are being put in place to enforce the enhanced Level-4 lockdown regulations. According to the council, in Bulawayo there were 333 burials in May, with 21 from South Africa and two from Botswana. Councillors said they were concerned that some residents were not adhering to the Covid-19 regulations. “Councillor Joyce Ndlovu noted that residents did not adhere to the 30 stipulated number of people allowed in the cemetery per burial. Most residents used their political affiliation as an excuse,” read the minutes. However, the Deputy Mayor, Clr Mlandu Ncube said it was difficult to regulate the numbers attending burials. “Culturally, a burial had an open invitation. Residents should be encouraged to stick to the stipulated numbers of mourners who attend burial at the cemetery. It was also prudent to observe other stipulated Covid-19 regulations,” read the minutes. Alderman Monica Lubimbi concurred and said the stipulated 30 mourners at the cemetery should be adhered to. The Director of Health Services Dr Edwin Sibanda explained that the 30 mourners at a cemetery was to reduce congestion and allow for social distancing. The Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube encouraged councillors to engage with residents regarding the new normal and the 30 mourners’ rule would remain in force during this period of Covid-19. Zimbabwe has 67 765 confirmed cases, including 45 617 recoveries and 2 185 deaths.  To date, a total of 895 980 people have been vaccinated against COVID-19. @bonganinkunzi
