The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Online Reporter ZIMBABWEANS have been advised to abide by the law and not to join in the looting spree in South Africa. Zimbabwe’s chief envoy to South Africa, Ambassador David Hamadziripi, told national broadcaster ZBC TV that people need to respect and observe the law. “Keep away from these protests and gatherings that we are seeing. We want to remind our nationals, as we always do, that one of their obligations . . . is to respect and observe the laws of this country,” he said. Violence and looting have gripped South Africa’s KwaZulu Natal and Gauteng provinces, over the past four days after the imprisonment of the country’s former president Jacob Zuma. Hundreds of shops and major supermarkets in malls have been ransacked during the unrest. So far, 72 people have been killed in a country that is home to thousands of Zimbabweans who work and live there.
