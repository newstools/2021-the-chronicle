HIGHLANDERS are likely to breathe a huge sigh of relief heading into this weekend’s Chibuku Super Cup game should they successfully register five of their players that have been waiting for reverse international clearances. Bosso kicked off their Chibuku Super Cup heavily crippled, with five of their new signings ruled out awaiting the international transfer window which opens today. Joel Ngodzo, Keith Mavunga, Winston Mhango, who were in Zambia, Peter Muduhwa, who was on loan to Simba Sports Club of Tanzania as well as Lynoth Chikuhwa, who was in Botswana, could feature for Highlanders when they take on Bulawayo Chiefs on Sunday if their registrations are successful. The opening of the transfer window, which will close at the end of the month, will allow clubs to beef up their squads if they so wish.
Zifa spokesperson Xolisani Gwesela confirmed opening of the transfer window. “The transfer window opens tomorrow and clubs interested in doing business have to do their transactions through the transfer matching system (TMS). The window closes on July 31,” said Gwesela. Highlanders’ coach Mandla Mpofu hopes the transfers sail through. <img class="wp-image-555114 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Mandla-“Lulu”-Mpofu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Mandla-“Lulu”-Mpofu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Mandla-“Lulu”-Mpofu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mandla “Lulu” Mpofu “Look, we’ve been playing without many options and the players who started our title defence have held their own. It won’t be an easy walk in the park for the players who will be registered when the window opens. Their availability will give us more options,” said Mpofu. With central defender Andrew Tandi nursing an ankle injury while Andrew Mbeba is on national duty preparing for the Cosafa Cup, Muduhwa is expected to bring stability to the Highlanders’ defence. Ngodzo could be the right replacement for injured Divine Mhindirira, who is out with a knee injury. Mhango might have to wait for his turn as Nqobizitha Masuku and Adrian Silla have formed a formidable partnership in central midfield. Chicken Inn will also be beefing up their squad, with defender Pawell Govere, the only Division One player who made it into the Warriors’ squad that took part in the African Nations Championship (Chan) tournament held in Cameroon at the beginning of the year, among their signings. The 26-year-old defender, who is in the books of ambitious Zifa Northern Region Division One side Golden Eagles, impressed Gamecocks’ coach Joey Antipas during his trial stint. Govere, who found his way into the locally-based Warriors assembled squad after impressing national team coach Zdravko Logaruaic during a practice match in the build-up to the Chan finals, has been training with Chicken Inn since April. Antipas Chicken will also register former FC Platinum and Chippa United defender Elvis Moyo. Moyo, whose contract with Chippa was terminated last September just a year into his two-year contract, has also been training with the Gamecocks. Midfielders Sipho Ndlovu and Tafadzwa Kutinyu will also be added to the Chicken Inn squad.
Moyo and Kutinyu could not be registered at the start of the Chibuku Super Cup as they were waiting for reverse international clearances.
