THE Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) has approved a Covid-19 operations manual submitted by organisers of the annual Bonaqua Africa Triathlon Union Cup Troutbeck for the 2021 edition to be held in September. Event director Rick Fulton said they had placed stringent measures that will ensure strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols in their preparation for the 15th edition of the competition. Barring any changes, the Bonaqua Africa Triathlon Union Cup Troutbeck is set for September 15 at Troutbeck Resort in Nyanga. Fulton said the global pandemic had changed lives and habits of the people, and this affects how they will manage the forthcoming competition. “Covid-19 protocols will be structured in two ways, implementation of the national protocols, regulations and associated restrictions as well as implementation of the World Triathlon Covid-19 protocols for event organisers for all venues and operations. Covid-19 protocols are critical to our planning and management of these processes in an in-depth 32-page Covid-19 operations manual that has already been submitted to SRC and approved. “This will be updated relevant to the new event date and respective national and World Triathlon adjustments to our operational procedures. “We already have had extensive experience for these processes at our local events and through first hand exposure to other African Cups and championships. “Critical to planning the event will be considered contingency options to allow for flexibility to deal with all scenarios that can be implemented quickly and efficiently. “This will extend to arrivals, on-site protocols, race protocols and departures. Close liaison with the resort will be required for the controls and management of all protocols with regard to their domain and ours,” said Fulton.
