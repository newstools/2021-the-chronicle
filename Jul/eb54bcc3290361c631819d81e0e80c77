The Chronicle Business Editor THE Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) has recorded $108,93 billion gross revenue collections for the second quarter ended 30 June 2021, which is 15,96 percent above the set target of $93,93 billion. All revenue heads registered positive growth while refunds valued at $2,29 billion were paid during the quarter under review, resulting in net revenue settling at $106.64 billion.

All revenue heads registered positive growth in nominal terms.” After adjusting for inflation, Mrs Matambo said net revenue grew by 202,30 percent in the second quarter 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020.
