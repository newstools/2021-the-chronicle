The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent GWANDA-based hip hop artiste Sbhevara has called on people from Matabeleland South to register to vote through a song which he will release tomorrow titled South. The track comes as Matabeleland provinces risk having fewer constituencies and wards when delimitation is done as some areas have low numbers of registered voters. Matabeleland South Province has 13 constituencies. A constituency should be made up of about 26 000 voters. The song that will be available on YouTube, SoundCloud, Audiomack and Spotify was produced by R2Records. “We’re facing a challenge where constituencies might be delimited so I’ve penned a song which calls on the public from the rainbow province to register to vote in the upcoming 2023 elections. “The song that’ll be released tomorrow is meant to conscientise people that registration is on and they should liaise with their voting sectors so that they don’t get counted out come next year’s elections,” he said. “Their voices and opinions help in the governing of Zimbabwe hence a positive to the country going forward and development.” – @mthabisi_mthire
