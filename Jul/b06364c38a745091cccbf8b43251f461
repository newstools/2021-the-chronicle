THE Zimbabwe Women’s Rugby 15s team left the country on Sunday evening for Uganda to take part in the Women’s Rugby Africa Cup.
Zimbabwe are in Pool C with hosts Uganda. The Lady Cranes will play Zimbabwe in two reverse fixtures to determine who progresses to the next round of the competition, which serves as World Cup qualifier. The first encounter is set for Wednesday and the second game will be played on Sunday. For the Lady Cranes, this will be the first competitive match they will be playing since 2019, the year that marked the nation’s return to international women’s rugby in the Elgon Cup. Meanwhile, Burkina Faso are expected in the country on Friday for the Rugby Africa Cup pool D fixtures against the Zimbabwe men’s side. The Stallions, winners of last month’s Rugby Africa repêchage, which also featured Cameroon and Burundi held in Ouagadougou, will face the Sables in back-to-back fixtures in Harare on July 18 and 22.
