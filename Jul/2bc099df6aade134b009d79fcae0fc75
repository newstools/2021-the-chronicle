SPONSORS of the Bonaqua Africa Triathlon Cup Troutbeck say the competition is one of the best run sporting events in Zimbabwe. Speaking during an online media workshop yesterday aimed at marketing the competition, which is tentatively set for the end of September, Toyota Zimbabwe manager Carl Varg said every corporate organisation wanted to be associated with well-run sports bodies, and Triathlon Zimbabwe, led by its president David Ellis, was a shining beacon among national sports associations. “It’s always good to support a well-run event and congratulations to Triathlon Zimbabwe. It’s very easy to come on board and sponsor such events where there is accountability,” said Varg. Bon Marche’s Fadzayi Chariga said it was easy for them to give US$12 500 for this year’s event due to the consistent professionalism displayed by Ellis’ executive committee. “We didn’t even think twice about coming on board. Professionalism is key and Triathlon Zimbabwe is an epitome of that,” said Chariga.
Nial Rooney, managing director of Rooneys, said Triathlon Zimbabwe was streets ahead of other national sports associations in terms of administration. “As alluded to by other fellow sponsors, Triathlon Zimbabwe is an example of how sports should be managed and we are happy to be associated with them,” Rooney said. Cimas group marketing manager Bhekimpilo Ntini said they were proud to be associated with Triathlon Zimbabwe, particularly the Troutbeck event. “The event is magnificent and well run, and for us to be part of such events gives us satisfaction,” said Ntini.
