The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Online Reporter YOUNG athletes Clinton Muunga (18) and Samukeliso Ndebele (17) are geared up to represent Zimbabwe at the World Junior Championships to be held in Kenya, Nairobi next month. The two youngsters said they have embarked on a rigorous training programme to ensure that they bring the gold home. Matabeleland South sprinter Muunga said his target was to achieve a time of 10.20 seconds and 20.90 seconds for the 100m and 200m races compared to his qualifying time of 10.46 seconds and 21.21 seconds. Ndebele, from Harare, said her target for the 100m race was 22.30 seconds compared to her qualifying time of 23.30 seconds. Muunga, who is a member of the Lisimati and Mabhikwa (LM) Athletics Academy in Matabeleland South, said his journey in athletics started when he was in Grade Three. “I’m excited that I will be representing the nation in the World Junior Championships in Nairobi, Kenya. I started competing in athletics when I was in Grade Three. Funny enough it was my sister who identified my talent. I used to race with her and when she realised that I had a talent she advised me to start participating in school competitions. “When I was in Grade Four, I started participating in national competitions. In 2017 I represented the nation in Cosafa Southern Africa Athletics Competitions. I’m glad that I will be representing the nation once again and my goal is to reach the finals,” he said. Muunga said being a member of the LM Athletics Academy has helped him enhance his performance as an athlete. He said for the past seven months he has been training extensively and he was glad that his efforts had paid off and he was hoping to record yet another success. “Right now, I’m focusing on my training so that I perform well. I’m very particular about my diet as I mainly eat food that is high in protein. I limit carbohydrates and acidic foods. I’m also following each and every advice that I’m getting from my coach. I want to be in best shape ever, come the competitions,” he said. Muunga’s coach Phakamile Lisimati, who is also LM Academy director and National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) national director of coaching and talent identification development, said the academy identified Muunga while he was in Form Two during school competitions. He said from then they have been working hard to turn Muunga into a regional champion. Lisimati said they were thrilled as an academy to produce such talent. “It’s our objective as an academy to assist students to pursue both academic and athletic careers. We hope to train more children of such good talent and turn them into champions,” he said. Ncube, who is a student at Dzivarasekwa High School in Harare and hails from Umguza District in Matabeleland North Province, said she represented the nation in athletics competitions that were held in Botswana and Swaziland. <img class="wp-image-555537 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Samukeliso-Ncube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Samukeliso-Ncube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Samukeliso-Ncube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Samukeliso Ncube She said being a member of Lasoc Athletic Club had greatly assisted her to develop her talent.
