Born in 1940 in Gweru, Helen, together with her husband Roy Guthrie, established Gallery Delta which has been very instrumental in nurturing a lot of young visual artists by giving them space to flaunt their respective aesthetic talents. With an incredible knack for identifying and nurturing artistic talent, Helen regularly imparted her invaluable visual arts skills to many artists, assisting them to blossom into top-notch creatives. <img class="alignnone wp-image-557685 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/ujuj2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/ujuj2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/ujuj2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “With the death of Helen, Zimbabwe has lost an exceptionally talented practitioner and arts administrator who contributed to the growth and development of the visual arts by putting the sector on the world’s artistic map. May her soul Rest In Peace.”
