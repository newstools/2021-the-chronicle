The Chronicle Showbiz Correspondent A BULAWAYO-based film production house Club of Victors has started filming an action series titled Jaws of Death. So far, the production team has shot three episodes from a target of 10 at various locations around Bulawayo, Victoria Falls and Harare. Film director and author, Gift Wazvaremhaka aka Borntrouble said through this production, they want to prove that Zimbabwe has what it takes to produce quality films. “We’re working an action-packed series named Jaws of Death. The storyline is based on Skypper against the Gangsters (Black Bandits) following the murder of his father who was once part of these notorious guys. “The series’ creativity is just what the industry needs as the animation and the production in general will surely wow fans,” said Borntrouble. One of Borntrouble’s recognisable works is the 2017 production, Wakazvinyira Wega, a drama that he directed and also starred in as one of the characters.
