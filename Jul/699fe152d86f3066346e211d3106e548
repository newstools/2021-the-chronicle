The Chronicle Two gendarmes in Cameroon were killed and then beheaded overnight in an attack by secessionists, officials says. The bodies were found on Wednesday morning in Babadjou, a town which borders Cameroon’s North-West region – one of two areas where fighters are seeking to break away. Gisèle Tsangue, the mayor of Babadjou, said it was an attack by separatists on a checkpoint and a third officer was missing. The UN estimates that at least 3,500 people have been killed in the English-speaking regions of North-West and South-West Cameroon since the secessionist conflict began in late 2016. Anglophone activists say the country’s French-speaking majority is marginalising the English-speaking minority. — BBC news
