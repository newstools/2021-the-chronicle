ZIMBABWE will get to enjoy home advantage when they host the International Cricket Council Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier in November. The tournament is the final part of the qualification process for the 2022 Women’s Cricket World Cup to be held in New Zealand. The qualifier should initially have been held in Zimbabwe, but it was moved to Sri Lanka when Zimbabwe’s ICC membership was frozen out in July 2019 before being readmitted in October in the same year. The country’s suspension came after the Sports and Recreation Commission suspended the Zimbabwe Cricket board. On Wednesday, the ICC board decided that the tournament be shifted from Sri Lanka to Zimbabwe for logistical reasons. In April, the ICC decided that the tournament was to be held at the end of this year. The countries set to compete in the event are Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Ireland, Pakistan, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, Netherlands and United States of America. From the qualifier, three teams will make it to New Zealand. Australia, England, South Africa and host nation New Zealand have already qualified for the World Cup. The news that the country is hosting the qualifier should come as sweet music to the Lady Chevrons’ coach Adam Chifo, whose team has never been to the World Cup. Before they compete in the 50-over Cricket World Cup qualifier, Zimbabwe will take part in the ICC Women’s Qualifier Africa to be staged in Botswana in September. — @Mdawini_29
