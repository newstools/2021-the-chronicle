The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter The Sports and Recreation Commission says the safe return of football can only be guaranteed if the Premier Soccer League resorts to a bio-bubble format, which effectively pours cold water on the possibility of early resumption. The bio-bubble was initially proposed by the PSL, but shelved the plans due to financial incapacity and resorted to the current format of mandatory testing before training and every game. In its position paper on the suspension of sporting activities and events, the SRC said although games were being played in a controlled environment with pre-match testing of players, fumigation of stadia and zoning of playing areas, it was still not sufficient to circumvent the continued spread of the virus under the current third wave since players and officials were commuting from home. “It is clear that protocols designed to mitigate the lack of a bio-secure bubble for players and officials (the costs were said to be prohibitive) were not being effectively adhered to or monitored by the affected individuals and clubs resulting in the rising rate of infections. This posed a significant risk of infection from their respective communities (which were not a controlled environment) in circumstances where the rate of local transmission has significantly increased as evidenced by the numbers released by the Ministry of Health and Child Care. Without placing footballers and officials in a bio-secure bubble, the immediate return of Premier League football in the present environment is simply not possible. “A positive player risks infecting teammates, close family members and subsequently, the community. It is clear that any return to topflight football at this stage can only happen if a full bio-secure bubble environment is implemented where players and officials reside in controlled environments for the duration of the tournament. This is the position implemented by cricket and rugby, among other protocols, leading to the various exceptions granted to them in the present environment,” said the SRC.
