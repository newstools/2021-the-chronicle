The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) will settle for foreign-based players for the Under-23 International Championships set for Hungary in August. The competition was initially set to be held in Tunisia, but due to the rise in Covid-19 cases in the north African country, the championships were moved to Hungary. ZVA communications officer Dave Simba said the association was finalising registration logistics for the competition. “Our secretariat is busy with registration for the competition. Once that is done we will then ask the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) for clearance to participate in the competition with the hope that they allow us given that we will be using foreign-based players. The players will fly from their bases straight to the host nation,” said Simba The SRC has placed all sporting activities on ice except for special waivers given to Zimbabwe Cricket and  Zimbabwe Rugby Union for national teams to host international series.
