The Chronicle One day I was praying, and I asked God to give me the secret that David had, that caused him to behave the way he did. I know that God can give trillions, but what I wanted to understand was how a man could bring trillions to God. Even if God gives people one million, in my many years in pastoral ministry, I have seen how people struggle to give large amounts of money to God. I have noticed that you can pray for people and they become very wealthy but most of them backslide while others fall back into poverty again. It is not an easy thing to maintain a faithful life once you abound in wealth.
God showed me a scripture. After David gave thousands of gold and silver, bronze, glittering stones and wood, He praised the Lord and said;
1 Chronicles 29:11-12 Thine, O LORD, [is] the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all [that is] in the heaven and in the earth [is thine]; thine [is] the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all. Both riches and honour [come] of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand [is] power and might; and in thine hand [it is] to make great, and to give strength unto all. (KJV)
Which is according to Haggai 2, (also read James 1:19). This means that David acknowledged that the money he had belonged to God, and he was just a steward. He fought off the spirit of greed and pride. He humbled himself even though he had gained a lot of wealth. In most cases the temptation that comes when you begin to be blessed by God is thinking it is your own wisdom and hard work that got you where you are. My question to you is, how many people are running around, working hard and getting nothing? God bless!
