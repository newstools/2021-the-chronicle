FORMER 400m national champion and a member of Team Zimbabwe to the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, Elijah Nkala has made an impassioned plea to the Government to invest in athletics facilities. Speaking in an interview at his rural home in Umzingwane district, Nkala, who was also the Zone 6 champion from 1985 until his retirement in 1992, said lack of adequate sporting facilities and equipment, especially in the rural areas, was the major reason the country continued to fair badly in international competitions like the Olympics. “Athletics needs talent as well as the right environment for one to do well. We have been struggling in international events, not because we don’t have talent but because of lack of proper facilities and equipment. “In the rural areas, our kids find themselves focusing mainly on track events yet someone could be a talented discus or shot put thrower. I wish our Government could have a special budget for sports, especially athletics. This is where I think we are lacking as a country,” said Nkala. The former Hwange Athletics Club athlete’s personal best in the 400m race is 46,6 seconds. Upon retirement from the sport, he formed an athletics club, Mawabeni Athletics Club, in his village and has been holding regular competitions, especially marathons while some of his athletes have also been participating in national events, particularly those held in Bulawayo. “With proper funding, we also could be inviting other clubs to this place for competitions but because we don’t have proper facilities, we can only organise local competitions like marathons hence my clarion call to the Government to have a deliberate position towards athletics, especially in rural areas, because I know talent is in abundance here. It just needs exposure and proper facilities,” said the former Mzingwane High School pupil.
