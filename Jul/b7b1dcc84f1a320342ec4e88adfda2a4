THE Environmental Management Agency (EMA) has warned members of the public against starting veld fires to avoid the destruction of the environment. Last week, the EMA Midlands provincial team launched the fire week and has been conducting awareness campaigns in preparation for the fire season which begins at the end of July. Provincial Spokesperson, Mr Oswald Ndlovu said veld fires remain a threat to sustainable management of natural resources as they affect critical economy enablers such as agriculture, forestry and wildlife among others. He said campaigns have already kickstarted as the agency seeks to reduce veld fires. “As EMA, we have been issuing farmers with fire orders for the ways to construct standard fire guards around their premises. We have also held awareness campaigns to educate farmers about veld fires in preparation of the fire season,” said Mr Ndlovu. In 2020, Midlands lost a total of 24 234.94 hectares of vegetation to veld fires, with major causes attributed to land clearance for farming purposes and negligent disposal of cigarette stubs among others. In the Midlands, Kwekwe, Chirumhanzu, Gweru and Shurugwi have been identified as hotspots. EMA is also intensifying demonstrations of fire guard construction, hay baling, controlled burning and firefighting.
More fires are being predicted this year due to heavy rains that increased biomass.
