HEALTH authorities in Matabeleland North have expressed concern over mushrooming shebeens, especially in Hwange town, which they said have contributed to a sharp rise in new cases of Covid-19. Some private schools have also been reportedly disregarding lockdown rules as they continue to conduct lessons putting learners, their families and community in danger. Last week Chronicle carried a story of Shalom Kids Learning Centre in Mkhosana, Victoria Falls, which had been conducting lessons for Grades 5 to 7 despite the lockdown announced by President prohibiting any gathering including schools. Some private schools in Victoria Falls are reportedly conducting lessons disregarding laid down lockdown rules as they want to get money from parents through fees. Matabeleland North recorded 41 new cases and three deaths on Sunday, taking the cumulative number to 2 791 since the first case was reported last year. Hwange is the hardest hit in the province with 980 cases and 14 deaths. There were 219 actives cases in Hwange and 91 in Victoria Falls as of Sunday. As of Saturday, Umguza had a total of 646 cases, Lupane 306, Binga 287, Nkayi 232, Tsholotsho 194 and Bubi 141. Chronicle gathered that there are several shebeens that have sprouted in Hwange, especially in Empumalanga suburb. Sources said most of them are operated by high profile people in the coal mining town which explains why they are not being closed. People reportedly drink all night at the various shebeens despite existence of a 6.30pm to 6am curfew. Greater Whange Residents Association Trust co-ordinator Mr Fidelis Chima said shebeens are all over Hwange. “Shebeens are all over Hwange and we have approached authorities about the issue. Our wish is for the Covid-19 taskforce to work closely with residents’ associations structures so as to come up with a lasting solution to this. We can work together to conscientise residents of the risks of running shebeens and also disseminating information on Covid-19,” he said. Hwange District medical officer Dr Fungai Musinami-Mvura said shebeens, just like funeral wakes that resident continue to attend while not following laid down protocol, are high risk gatherings. “The problem with shebeens is that once people get drunk, they become a high risk gathering because no one will be following regulations. We plead with people to follow regulations and if they want to drink alcohol, they should rather buy and drink from home. We once visited Hwange and we were told about the shebeens. These shebeens could be one of the contributors of the high rates of Covid we are having in the district particularly in Hwange town,” said Dr Musinami-Mvura. She implored people to follow general health guidelines such as masking up and minimising gatherings. Dr Musinami-Mvura said the war against Covid-19 may not be won because of carelessness, as she urged people to get vaccinated. She said vaccination is the safest intervention that can ensure quick recovery of industry especially tourism. “If we do not manage this pandemic, we will be in trouble. Covid-19 is not about an individual, we should think about those who are vulnerable in the community. We haven’t managed to vaccinate as many people as we want and as we expect the next supply of vaccines, we will target Hwange urban. We encourage people to come and vaccinate in numbers. Statistics have shown us that people who are not vaccinated are more at risk than those who are vaccinated. That is the reason why the trend shows more new cases in Hwange compared to Victoria Falls,” she said. A total of 32 586 people received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccination in Hwange District, 20 883 of them in Victoria Falls alone. Matabeleland North provincial medical director Dr Munekai Padingani implored police to enforce lockdown regulations. <img class="wp-image-557544 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Mr-Fidelis-Chima.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Mr-Fidelis-Chima.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Mr-Fidelis-Chima-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Fidelis Chima He said the major causes of spike in cases is not adhering to regulations. The prevailing Delta variant has compounded the situation especially since it is winter, said Dr Padingani. “No school is supposed to be open. We can’t comment much on shebeens because it is the police who should enforce. For us sometimes we only get to know when they are linked to our patients, but complacency is the biggest challenge. You find people queuing like there is no Covid-19 and most, especially in rural areas they do not wear masks. “We need to make sure many people get vaccinated because based on statistics not many of those who were vaccinated are being affected. People need to follow what President Mnangagwa prescribed and stick to protocol. People are supposed to understand and all of us should sensitise each other because this disease can remain with us forever but it’s up to us to change our behaviour and prevent it,” he said.
