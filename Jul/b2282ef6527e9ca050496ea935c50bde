Fanta Elliot Moyo (66) was remanded in custody to July 28 when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Linear Khumalo. Moyo pleaded guilty to charges of rape.

Prosecutor Mr Milton Ncube said that on a date unknown to the prosecutor from the month of June to the 10th of July this year, Moyo had sexual intercourse with the mentally challenged woman in the bush where the victim stays. “On a date unknown to the prosecutor from the month of June to the 10th of July this year AT Mbembeswana village at Inyathi, Moyo had sexual intercourse several times with a female mentally challenged in the bush where the victim stays,’’ he said.
