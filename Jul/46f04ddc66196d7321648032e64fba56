Old Mutual Amazing Voices finalists, Effect who were eliminated from the competition last week, have said they are working on recording an EP to ride on the hype that has been created by the show around them. The all-male group that charmed many with its sexiness and singing talent also said it would not mind giving the show another try next year for the sake of some of their members who could not travel to South Africa. The soulful group whose members are from Bulawayo, missed the Pan African singing competition’s finale by a whisker as they were booted out just two weeks before the end of the competition. Three groups, Hush from South Africa, 121 Selah from Nigeria and The Unveiled from Harare, Zimbabwe are left in the running. The winners who will walk away with US$100 000 are set to be announced tomorrow. <img class="wp-image-555702 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/121-Selah.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/121-Selah.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/121-Selah-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> 121 Selah Chronicle Showbiz caught up with Effect upon their return home and the group shared their experience in South Africa. It was an emotional journey for them as they had to form a totally new group upon arrival in South Africa. This was after some members failed to travel as they did not have travel documents. In honour of these members who could not be part of the action in South Africa, some Effect members have said they will consider re-entering the show next year for these members to also have an experience. Below is an interview with the group on their experience in South Africa and their future plans. Q: How was your stint on the show? A: The experience was great and the competition was very tough. The show was very interesting and exciting. Of course there were a lot of nerve-wracking moments for us as it was tough from day one and nothing was ever certain for us. The greatest feeling always came whenever we qualified for the next round. It was the best feeling, overcoming the nerve-wracking moments, both on and off the stage. That’s the most interesting part of the Old Mutual Amazing Voices show, it’s so entertaining and unpredictable. Q: What lessons did you take from the show? A: We learnt a lot from the show, on and off the stage. The viewers only saw the tip of the iceberg on TV, but deeply behind the scenes, we worked with a lot of people. We got many lessons from the vocal coaches, choreographers and the music director of the show. From the many lessons we had, the most important thing we learned was that as artistes, we should balance between what we love and what the audience loves. Doing what satisfies our souls only and not the audience won’t work in the music industry. This was the first lesson we got on our first day at Sun City. <img class="wp-image-555705 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Hush-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Hush.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Hush-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Hush Secondly, we learnt that becoming a family first as a group was crucial and played a vital role in making us understand each other musically. Thirdly, we learnt how to be superstars and become sellable as a band, which was the most exciting part. Q: Where to from here? A: After Amazing Voices, we shall continue singing and working on our art. We will incorporate all the lessons we got from the show into our art and music as we move forward. We will also teach our other members (who didn’t make it to SA) things and new skills we got from the show. Q: Do you plan to enter the competition again? A: We don’t wanna think about entering the competition again, at least for now as our focus is on using this wave that we got from the show to propel ourselves to greater heights. We’re working tirelessly and pushing hard for the group brand to grow. But also, there are talented members like Larry, Oscar and Nkosi who didn’t manage to go to SA and it pained us to see such talented guys remain behind. So, if ever we are to think of joining the competition again, it will be solely for these members. The reason will solely be to have these members experience what we experienced. I feel they have to learn many things and that Amazing Voices experience is the best they can ever learn from. But for now, as Effect, we move forward and continue pushing and working hard on our music. Q: Are there plans to record an album? <img class="wp-image-553565 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-33-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-33-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-33-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Unveiled A: Effect is planning to record an album and if all goes well, we will record an EP as well (just extra content for the people who have been supporting us in our OMAV journey and inspired by the OMAV experience). Of course for now it’s too early to give more details. Q: Which group do you think will win the competition? A: That’s a tricky one. I know viewers already have their favourites but speaking from the actual experience on the show, all the remaining groups — The Unveiled, Hush and 121 Selah are very good and they have actually worked very hard to get there. Any group can win it. Last season, Wanavokali won when everyone else was rooting for the two groups from South Africa. Wanavokali had more votes at the end. So this season, you never know. Anything can happen despite Hush and 121 Selah making the waves.
