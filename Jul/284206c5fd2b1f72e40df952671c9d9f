ALL-ROUNDER Donald Tiripano says the Chevrons need to work on all aspects of their game to improve on their performance in the Test loss to Bangladesh. Bangladesh rolled over Zimbabwe by 220 runs in the Test match, which ended at Harare Sports Club on Sunday. The two sides will now shift focus to the three-match ODI series that begins on Friday. The ODIs form part of the ICC Super League and serve as the main route for qualification for the 2023 edition of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in India. The second ODI will be played on july 18, with the final match following two days later. Tiripano believes they Zimbabwe let Bangladesh off the hook in the afternoon session of the first day when the visitors were struggling at 132/6. “We started well in the morning of the first day. The wicket was doing a bit. After taking six wickets, we let them off. Mahmudullah and Liton Das put together a partnership. I think we have to make sure that when we get into such positions, we have to get them by the throat and finish them off,” said Tiripano. On the upcoming ODI series he said conditions will not change much. “Harare Sports Club is looking a bit flat. We are looking forward to some exciting high scoring games. We just need to take care of all departments of the game. We have to make sure that when we are batting, we put a good score and when bowling we bowl tight and take our chances in fielding.” Bangladesh will conclude the tour with T20I matches set for July 23, 25 and 27.
