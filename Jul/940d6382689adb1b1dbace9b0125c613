HARD work and determination remain qualities no one can take away from Zimbabwean women, whether young or old. In most cases brilliant ideas arguably emanate from women, usually working in the background though men usually take all the credit. In Zimbabwe, making shoes and sandals has been a preserve for men, with women focusing on tailoring clothes, curtains and other such products. Men have dominated the field of shoe making with women mostly working as support staff. Some women have now managed to break into this male-dominated field to claim their space. A 32-year-old woman, Ms Alice Kaschula from Old Pumula in Bulawayo, has proved that women can also make shoes,sandals and belts. Ms Kaschula who has a disabled son, said that she has noticed that most parents with children living with disabilities depend on handouts from the Government and well-wishers. “I have a son living with a disability and what I have noticed with most mothers of disabled children is that they want people to feel sorry or pity for them because of the condition of their children. Some feel it is a must for them to be helped by people or the Government. I learnt that it teaches my son to depend on members of the public and to be lazy,’’ she said. Ms Kaschula said with her hands she discovered that she can be creative and that will motivate her son to do something with his hands and desist from depending on handouts. She can copy any design and bring it out as it is. “I discovered my hands can do creative work so I learnt how to make rugmats using chunky wool but the material is too expensive locally. Sometime this year I discovered sandal making. The material to make Sandals is called a Drawcord. I can copy any design and bring it out with my hands,’’ she said. <img class="wp-image-558214 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Ms-Alice-Kaschula-of-Pumula-4-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Ms-Alice-Kaschula-of-Pumula-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Ms-Alice-Kaschula-of-Pumula-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Alice Kaschula’s products Ms Kaschula did not have prior knowledge of making sandals but because of determination and courage she managed to do so. She highlighted that accessing markets and also equipment is a huge challenge. “Business is low as a result of the lockdown. I also do not have a proper market hence I sell my products to the local community. I also take my products to other places when I travel to attend workshops, and church meetings and at times I use social media platforms to advertise my work,” said Ms Kaschula. The sky is the limit for Ms Kaschula who said she wants to have her own factory that will manufacture sandals, belts and rugmats. “I want to achieve great things through hard work. One day I would like to open my own factory that will manufacture sandals,belts, wallets and rugmats. A factory which will have all the machinery needed for sewing these items,’’ said Ms Kaschula. She said what she needs urgently is a workshop where she can operate from. Ms Kaschula encouraged other women to venture in different projects despite the obstacles. “In business we face many challenges but as women we should never give up. It is not easy as sometimes we face competition and stigma but we need to work hard in order to produce the best,” she said. Ms Kaschula urged other women to venture into different income-generating projects. “Most women give excuses of lacking capital to start a business but I came to realise that one does not need much to start a business,’’ she said. She said one could start small and then grow.— @Boity104
