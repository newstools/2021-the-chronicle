THE second Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF2021) has been moved from Rwanda to South Africa following logistical constraints experienced by the East African country due to the Covid-19 pandemic. IATF2021, which was scheduled to take place in Kigali, Rwanda from December 8 to 14, is now slated for Durban, South Africa from November 15 to 21. AfreximBank, which is co-organising the event together with the African Union and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat, in a statement said: “The second IATF2021 has been rescheduled to take place in Durban, South Africa from 15 to 21 November 2021. “The trade Fair was previously due to be held in Kigali, Rwanda from 8 to 14 December 2021. “The decision to move the trade fair to Durban was made by the Advisory Council of IATF2021 at its 10th meeting held virtually on 25 May 2021.” It said the decision was arrived at after formal consultations with the Government of Rwanda, which indicated that logistical constraints related to the Covid-19 pandemic had adversely affected progress of the construction of a new facility to host the event. — @okazunga
