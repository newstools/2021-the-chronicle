The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent The Government through the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing on Monday dispatched a team to Kwekwe City Council to carry out a land and skills audit. The audit, which is expected to last more than a week, will also focus on devolution and ZINARA funds, as well as human resources issues. Midlands Provincial Development Coordinator, Mr Abiot Maronge said he could not comment on the issue. “I can only confirm that there is an audit currently underway at Kwekwe City Council and all I know is that it has an instruction from Minister July Moyo. I cannot say anything further than that for now,” he said. The audit comes in the wake of amplified concerns from councillors who recently raised a red flag during the past full council meeting at Town House, demanding to know how the housing department was selling stands. The councillors claimed that the housing department has been shadily parcelling out industrial, commercial and residential stands and called for an audit. During the same meeting, councillors accused municipal police officers of collecting funds which they do not remit to the local authority. Ward Six Councillor Maclean Nyamucherera said the local authority could be losing more than US$4 000 per month. The cash strapped local authority is struggling to pay a $112million ZESA debt. This also comes at a time when the MDC Alliance-led local authority has been struggling to execute projected devolution projects. Kwekwe City is converting Garandichauya Beerhall into an infectious diseases’ hospital, among other projects, but has been struggling due to shortage of funds. The council has been without a substantive Town Clerk since 2017 following the retirement of Mr Emmanuel Musara. Dr Lucia Mnkandla, the council’s Chamber Secretary, has been acting since Mr Emmanuel Musara departed.
