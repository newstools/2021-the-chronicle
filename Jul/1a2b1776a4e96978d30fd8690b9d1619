THE Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) says the high cost of operating energy infrastructure and inability to establish bankable projects are the major setbacks to manufacturing sector expansion in the region. Comesa assistant secretary general in charge of programmes in Comesa Dr Kipyego Cheluget during the recently held Regional Association of Energy Regulators for Eastern and Southern Africa 10th Annual General Meeting said high cost of operating energy infrastructure facilities and inability to prepare bankable projects are major impediment to the expansion of the manufacturing sector in the region. “It is however encouraging to note that most countries have realised that for any meaningful economic and human transformation to be realized, universal access to energy should be at the centre augmented by a strong political will and sustainable policy and legislative framework,” he said. The total installed capacity for electric power in the 21-member bloc that include countries such as Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Swaziland, Kenya,, Rwanda, Egypt, and Djibouti is around 92 000MW. Comesa estimates that the percentage of the population in the region with access to electricity is on average around 60 percent with projections indicating that it will be around 80 percent by 2040. “This will however depend on heavily investing in energy infrastructure in the next ten years,” it said. -@okazunga
