The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter Popular radio personality, KVG (real name Kudzai Violet Gwara) has encouraged people to consider taking a refresher driving course in order to improve their driving skills and generally, boost their driving confidence. This comes after she was recently asked to reverse a manual car and was not confident to do so as the only time, she was exposed to a manual car was seven years ago when she did her driving lessons. She said after obtaining her driving license, she went straight into driving the automatic car that she bought before getting a license. “I’m taking driving classes again. I obtained my license seven years ago and for me, that was very late (as she was under pressure to have one). I remember when I bought my first car, I had to park it and use kombis as I didn’t have a license. It took a lot of discipline. “…Fast forward to present day, last week I was asked to move a manual car from the driveway to make way for another car at home. I wasn’t confident to move it because the last time I drove a manual car was seven years ago when I was doing lessons. It really dented my confidence and that’s why I’ve decided to do a refresher course,” said the Star FM personality. And indeed, most people have similar stories to KVG as most cars, especially those that are imported, are automatic. Driving only automatic cars then affects people’s confidence in driving manual cars as the only manual car most will have been exposed to is that from the driving school. Another problematic area for most is parallel parking. Despite one driving for years, this parking is still challenging for many. Going for refresher courses, therefore, becomes key as one can work on these problem areas to reduce mistakes and improve their driving experience and that of other motorists while also boosting their driving confidence. One is also taught new driving developments.
