Afrika Revenge, a multi-award-winning Afro-fusion Zimbabwean band that became popular in 2004 with hits such as Wanga and Anochengeta that topped local charts was undoubtedly a darling of many. That same year, the group swept almost every accolade at the Zimbabwe Music Awards, walking home with the Song of the Year (Wanga), Best Male Artiste, Best Jazz Album as well as the Best Newcomer gongs. In 2005 Afrika Revenge which called their music Qaya Rootz won the Outstanding Album Award for Afrika Revenge Presents Qaya Musik and as many were looking forward to more hits from the duo of Willis Wataffi and Mehluli “Taz” Moyo, they split under unclear circumstances in 2006. This was the same year that the group had performed before one million fans in India at the 25th anniversary of the Art of Living, an Indian educational and humanitarian movement. Many wondered what could have caused the split at a time when the band was doing so well. <img class="wp-image-558113 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Africa-Revengee-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Africa-Revengee.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Africa-Revengee-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Afrika Revenge with Tuku at a show in South Africa Efforts to establish the main reason that led to the group’s split have been in vain as the duo has often skirted the issue. This week, South Africa-based music promoter, Tongai Mbirimi reminisced about the days when he promoted the popular band when it was at its peak, sharing some never told stories of their encounters. “I first booked boy band Afrika Revenge to perform in Kadoma in 2007. One of my weaknesses or strengths is I’m biased towards booking music I like. I was a fan of the Wanga boys and the first gig I booked them for was in Kadoma as they had been a sensation in Harare and Bulawayo with their hit song Wanga. “They came to Kadoma and boy or boy, they rocked the stage, turnout was good and omakorokoza enjoyed the show at The Ranch Motel. Afrika Revenge who were Willis and Taz were indeed good for business,” posted Mbirimi on his Facebook page. Like everyone else, Mbirimi who had hoped to continue promoting the duo for a while, shared how disheartened he was when he heard about their split. “I had really enjoyed working with them and was looking forward to working with them more into the future. To all our shock and horror, Afrika Revenge split in the coming year or so. How could such a great band break up? Only God knows why. All the plans we had for them, to bring them back to Kadoma for more gigs went up in smoke.” However, Mbirimi said he kept in touch with the group, something that saw him promote another show following their short-lived get back together. <img class="wp-image-558114 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Tongai-Mbirimi-for-Afrika-Revenge-Story-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Tongai-Mbirimi-for-Afrika-Revenge-Story.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Tongai-Mbirimi-for-Afrika-Revenge-Story-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tongai Mbirimi “As fate would have it, I kept in touch with them and their management. In 2015, the unexpected happened, Afrika Revenge re-united briefly. Guess what, I had a Tuku gig in Joburg at the Bassline Club and when I heard the news that the Wanga boys were back and doing gigs, I immediately booked them to come to Joburg and be a surprise support act for Tuku at the Joburg gig. “That concert is still stuck in my mind, it was lit. Shamie and Haroldine came from Cape Town as support acts and opened the show, next up was Afrika Revenge and they lit the stage. Tuku was the icing on the cake, the headline act. “Something weird though happened in Joburg before the show on October 23, 2015. I hired a kombi to carry Afrika Revenge from their hotel in Sandton to Bassline club in Newtown for sound check. As we waited for them to arrive, the kombi was hijacked by the taxis association in Braamfontein, something to do with the infringement of routes. Joburg is crazy and funny at times, the taxi association would not even entertain the fact that the kombi was a private hire, they just told Afrika Revenge to jump off or blood was to be shed. I was relaxed at the venue and a phone call came informing me that the band had been dumped in the middle of nowhere right in Joburg with their instruments and at the mercy of anything and everything that can possibly happen to anyone in Joburg CBD. “We then came up with a rescue plan for Afrika Revenge band and at that point, they were livid, though later on after the show we laughed about the incident.” It was at this event that the duo’s lead guitarist was apparently spotted by Tuku Music and asked to join them on stage during their set before later joining the group. “That was to be Rody’s job interview of joining the Black Spirits as unfortunately, the Wanga boys split again that same year. Rody the lead guitarist was to be a part of the Black Spirits band for years to come,” wrote Mbirimi. However, while the band is now defunct with Willis now pursuing a solo career, their timeless music exists among us.
