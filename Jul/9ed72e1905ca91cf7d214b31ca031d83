After three months of vocal coaching and singing to impress judges and viewers, the winner of the Old Mutual Amazing Voices competition will be unveiled tomorrow with the country’s hopes pinned on The Unveiled, a musical group from Harare. The Unveiled which managed to outshine many other groups from the continent to make it to the top three, is competing for the US$100 000 prize money with South Africa’s Hush and Nigeria’s 121 Selah. It has not been an easy journey but the group managed to control the heat and pressure. After having played their part well, winning the hearts of many renowned artistes including Tasha Cobbs and Joyous Celebration along the way, the group has now pinned its hopes on the show’s viewers and the country at large. Voting lines closed on Thursday and the group is waiting for the finale tomorrow. Speaking from South Africa, The Unveiled spokesperson Ashley Mapfumo said they have done all they could to win people’s votes and are hoping for the best as they wait for the finale. Whatever the outcome, Mapfumo said they were grateful for the experience as it exposed them to wider audiences. “Our performances on the show have opened new avenues for us as we’ve been getting support from across Africa. Voting lines closed on Thursday evening and we’re now just waiting for the finale to see who’ll emerge victorious,” said Mapfumo. And indeed, all attention is now on the finale as the show’s judges have taken the top three groups as far as they could with viewers also doing their best by casting votes for their favoured groups. The spectacular finale of the Old Mutual Amazing Voices will kick off at 5PM on Mzansi Magic and Zambezi Magic tomorrow and award-winning stars, Prince Kaybee and Sha Sha are expected to grace the stage.
