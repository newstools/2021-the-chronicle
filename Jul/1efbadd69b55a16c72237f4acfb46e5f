WITH just a few days to go before the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games get under way, Zimbabwe Swimming chairperson Tracey Doorman is confident their swimmers will give it their best shot. The Games will run from July 23 to August 8 in the Japanese capital. Zimbabwe is fielding five athletes from rowing, swimming, athletics and golf. Swimming has two athletes, Donata Katai and United States-based Peter Wetzlar. Katai is competing in the 100m backstroke and Wetzlar in the 100m freestyle. Doorman said it’s important for the swimmers to take part in the Games. “We know that they will give their all on this Olympic stage. We wish both athletes all the best, every success and look forward to the reports we receive. “For any sport code, Olympics and World Champs are the goals in everyone’s mind and on their radar. It is very important in promoting our sport and careers of the athletes and coaches who attend such events,” said Doorman. Zimbabwe got two slots from Fina under the universality system and Doorman says the level of competition locally is the major drawback to attaining qualifying times. “We have talented athletes who have the potential to qualify, but the level of local competitions doesn’t give them the ‘push’ they need to achieve them (qualifying times) locally. We have the coaches who have the expertise and experience. “Sadly it means for our athletes looking outside our borders for exposure and the push for qualification, it’s the reality. This has financial implications of course,” said Doorman. Katai and coach Lindsay Tudor-Cole are expected to leave for Japan on July 17, while Wetzlar is also scheduled to leave on the same day from his base in the United States.
