The launch was split into two sessions, praise and worship. During her worship session, she captivated audiences with her outfit that was designed by Sozinio (real name Freddy Jackson). It was not about the dress, but how she managed to minister to people through her worship songs. The backing vocalists, Mimie Tarukwana, Rebecca Hlongwane, Nomakhwezi Tshabalala, Nigel Nyamweda, Absalom Ndlovu and Outfit band were commended by the audience online for complementing AmandaGrace well. <img class="alignnone wp-image-558219 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Amanda-Grace-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Amanda-Grace-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Amanda-Grace-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> On the inspiration behind the album that was produced by Tiyelani “Tyce Keys” Chauke and band director Sammuzik, AmandaGrace said: “In trying times and seasons of uncertainty like the ones we live in, every man and woman must desire a God encounter. That’s what this album is about, a God encounter and because we’re under grace, we can come boldly to the throne of grace to obtain mercy in time of need. Now that’s unmerited favour.” While the project was recorded in studio last year as a result of the lockdown experience which led the artiste to pen the music, it was launched a year later. From the seven spirit-filled uplifting songs, Eweh Jesu got the most favourable response from comments during the live launch. Generally, the album is a balanced product with songs for different markets. “It’s after I realised a need to do something and feeling a different kind of uncertainty and emptiness that I decided to write my emotions to God. Immediately, Mbize was birthed from the lockdown last year. Songs like Fill Me Up, Umphefumulo Wam, Ndinoshuvira then also aligned to the season,” said AmandaGrace. <img class="alignnone wp-image-558222 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Amanda-Grace-2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Amanda-Grace-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Amanda-Grace-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> She said when she wrote Eweh which means yes, she believed people would one day get to a season when all this would go and then look back and say: “Yes God, it is you that brought us out of that and took us this far.” Shoko, one of the collaborations, AmandaGrace said, also speaks of the word of God which is a light through this dark season and time. <img class="alignnone wp-image-558224 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Amanda-Grace-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Amanda-Grace-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Amanda-Grace-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Featured on the album is Trust Samende, Mokoomba lead guitarist who played in Shoko and Bheka Mthethwa a prominent bassist from South Africa who played Eweh and Umphefumlo Wam.
