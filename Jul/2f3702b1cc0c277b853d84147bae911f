THE Zimbabwe Under-21 women’s field hockey team has qualified for the 2021 Junior World Cup to be held in South Africa based on their previous performance at the Junior Africa Cup in which they finished runners-up in 2016. This follows the cancellation of the Junior Africa Cup that had been scheduled for Windhoek, Namibia, from August 14-22 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The continental competition was to serve as a qualifier to the Junior World Cup, with two teams, men and women, qualifying in each category. Africa Hockey Federation (AfHF) used the previous results to determine teams that will advance to the global event. They announced the development on Tuesday. “The AfHF has been forced to take this decision given the unfortunate news of the highly contagious Covid-19 variant (s) hitting Namibia and the surrounding countries and the impossibility of having another postponement based on valid reasons as discussed with the FIH,” read part of a statement from Africa Hockey Federation. Zimbabwe joins 2016 champions South Africa in the women’s section. In the men’s competition, 2016 champions Egypt and runners-up South Africa also qualified. South Africa will host the women’s Junior World Cup from December 5-16, while the men’s event is due to take place in India from November 25 to December 5.
