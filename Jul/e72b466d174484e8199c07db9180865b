The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter Breakfast football matches return this weekend in the Chibuku Super Cup following an adjustment of kick-off times by the Premier Soccer League in compliance with the new lockdown restrictions announced by President Mnangagwa on Tuesday. Some matches will be played as early as 10am, according to a new fixtures’ programme released by the PSL on Thursday evening. There had been fears that the Chibuku Super Cup matches would again be put on hold following the Tuesday announcement by the President that saw the country going back to Level 4 restrictions following an upsurge in Covid-19 cases countrywide. Teams have also been on the receiving end, with the PSL being forced to postpone two matches inside four days after players and officials tested positive for the virus. The first to be iced was an encounter between ZPC Kariba and Harare City on Wednesday, which was meant to mark the second return of the Chibuku Super Cup. The electricity men’s players and officials tested positive and had to go into self-isolation in line with Covid-19 protocols. Next to be iced was a tie between Triangle United and Ngezi Platinum Stars scheduled for Mandava Stadium on Saturday after the Sugar Boys’ players and officials also tested positive. The postponement was in line with the PSL’s stance that if seven or more individuals from one team test positive, their match would be postponed. Breakfast matches were first introduced in the country by the Leo Mugabe led Zifa executive in the early 2000s as part of measures to punish a then trailblazing Highlanders for their supporters’ hooliganism.
