ONE of Bulawayo’s top nightclub DJs, DJ Mzoe has initiated an online show dubbed Twist Sessions to promote fellow DJs and ensure that they remain relevant by providing them with a platform to play and showcase their talents on the decks. For almost one-and-a-half years, most club DJs have not performed as nightclubs remain closed as part of a raft of measures meant to curb the spread of Covid-19. In a bid to ensure club DJs don’t lose their touch while also keeping people entertained during the lockdown, DJ Mzoe recently launched the show where the DJs take turns on the decks. The pre-recorded sets are being posted on social media platforms. DJ Mzoe said as a person who has been in the game for a while now, he felt the need to support his own through his fast-growing media company, Fudu Media. “The lockdown inspired me to initiate the online DJ shows. This was following the realisation that not many DJs were posting videos of their works online. “Remaining visible is very key especially during such a time hence I reached out to my colleagues so we ensure their works aren’t forgotten,” DJ Mzoe who is also into photography said. “So far, we’ve worked with DJs that include DJ Sweeto, DJ Zetfactor, DJ Crazy Dee and DJ Nicky Micks not forgetting myself.” He said the sets are being recorded at various venues in the city so as to give them a live feel while also promoting the city. “So far, we’ve recorded the sets at Killarney, Ntabantshu and Upper Umguza,” said DJ Mzoe. Last year, DJ Mzoe, a DJ who was popular for playing at nightclubs such as Forty 40 and Hustlers was one of the first DJs to initiate live sets on Facebook from the comfort of his home, a move that was embraced by many. — @mthabisi_mthire
