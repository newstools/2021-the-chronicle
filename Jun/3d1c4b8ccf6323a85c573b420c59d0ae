The Chronicle Labour is trying to pin the blame for surging coronavirus infections squarely on the prime minister today, dubbing the Delta strain of Covid-19 the “Boris Johnson variant”. The government’s “unforgivable recklessness” at the border is the cause of the surge and the delay to the end of lockdown, according to Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary. <img class="wp-image-552241 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Nick-Thomas-Symonds.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Nick-Thomas-Symonds.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Nick-Thomas-Symonds-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nick Thomas-Symonds It comes as NHS England announces that all over-18s in England should be able to book their first vaccine by the end of next week. Boosting vaccination rates is a key plank of Mr Johnson’s plan to reopen the economy on 19 July. Mr Johnson said yesterday he was confident no further delay would be necessary but was unable to rule that out, warning of the possibility that an unforeseen and “far more dangerous” variant could emerge. Scientists have warned more than 40,000 people could die this summer as the Delta variant sweeps through the UK, even after the decision to postpone the lifting of lockdown. – The Independent
