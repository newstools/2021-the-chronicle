The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent VERSATILITY is the simple depiction of songstress, Sinikiwe Ncube aka Nicky S Iqhawekazi who has grown over the years from being a gospel musician to taking up a genre largely associated with her male counterparts, Maskandi.

Speaking from South Africa, Nicky S Iqhawekazi said she is now working on her second album which will be released sometime next year as she is taking her time to churn out a fully-fledged production. She said she is also preparing to take to the stage in August as she is billed to perform at an all maskandi affair show in South Africa. “My vision is to make a name for myself in a genre that is largely dominated by men. I want to do this by giving my fans value for their money. “To achieve this, I’m working on my second album titled Indondo Yothando which will be out by end of March next year. I want to take time on this project in order to release quality music,” she said. Detailing the forthcoming album, she said it will be about appreciating the power of love and unity in societies.
