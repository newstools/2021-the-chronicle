HOPE has been restored for farmers operating at Moza Irrigation in Ward 5 in Gampu Village in Bulilima who anticipate to soon realise maximum production from their 90-hectare irrigation plot which is being rehabilitated. Harare based non-governmental organisation Cesvi Zimbabwe has invested US$612 000 towards rehabilitating and upgrading Moza Irrigation which has been underutilised for a long time. The works are underway with planting expected to start in September. The rehabilitation process involves replacing a canal system that was being used at the irrigation with a solar powered drip irrigation system. About 40 hectares is being targeted under the first phase. A villager who is operating at the irrigation, Ms Esnat Nleya said the investment was a great opportunity that they have been waiting for, for a long time. “We had the land as farmers but we were failing to utilise it because we didn’t have the capacity. I was producing for the purposes of getting food for my family and so were my colleagues. Now that we have been presented with an opportunity to maximise production, I’m very excited as that means I can finally start farming for commercial purposes,” she said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-550982 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Moza-irri.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Moza-irri.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Moza-irri-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The councillor of the area, Promise Masibi, said 400 farmers from Bulilima and Tsholotsho wards were operating in the irrigation plot. She said this development will improve livelihoods for many households. Cllr Masibi said her ward had seven villages which will benefit from the project. She said commercial farmers will be producing together with the small-scale farmers at the irrigation scheme. “Farmers have really been struggling. The flood system which was being used was taking up a lot of water resulting in huge water bills which farmers were struggling to pay. The drip irrigation system is really ideal as it uses less water. The infrastructure at the irrigation was also dilapidated and the engines were constantly breaking down which was causing problems for farmers,” she said. Gwanda Rural District Council chief executive officer, Mr John Brown Ncube said works at the irrigation started six months back. He said the irrigation scheme will be commissioned in a month’s time. “An NGO Cesvi Zimbabwe has partnered with the farmers and they have invested 500 000 euros towards rehabilitating Moza Irrigation. The irrigation is a total of 90 hectares and under the first phase 40 hectares is being rehabilitated. A solar system has been installed, engines have been put in place and pipes have been installed. “The irrigation will be commissioned in a month’s time or so while planting will start in September. The main purpose of the project is to ensure that the irrigation is commercialised and fully utilised. We will also bring in commercial or private farmers who will be working with local farmers to ensure maximum production,” he said. Mr Ncube said such partnerships are what communities need in order to realise development and fully utilise resources in their areas. He said about 40 locals are employed at the irrigation but once it started producing about 200 people will be employed. — @DubeMatutu
