HIGHLANDERS chairman Johnfat Sibanda says he does not believe in singling out individuals for success or failure, but it must be a team effort in good and bad times. Sibanda, who took over the Bosso reins in March this year, said the culture of singling out individuals creates untouchables within an institution. He heads and executive committee comprising vice-chairman Modern Ngwenya, secretary Morgan Dube, treasurer Donald Ndebele and committee member Mgcini Mafu. “We are introducing a new culture at Highlanders; a new ideology that recognises everyone within the structure. I don’t believe in separation of achievements or failures. Everyone must be accorded the same (praise and criticism) and that way we all pull and move at the same pace, hence my belief that we rise and fall as a team. “Highlanders’ success story, especially during my tenure, will not and should not be attributed to Johnfat Sibanda as chairman, but to the whole system, so must its failures if ever we will have any such situations,” said Sibanda. He appealed to the media not to individualise successes or failures because they will be working as a team. “This is why even when the head coach goes or comes, normally he brings his own personnel because it’s a team effort; they succeed and tumble as the whole technical team. This is what I also believe in when it comes to management and that’s the direction we have taken,” he said.
