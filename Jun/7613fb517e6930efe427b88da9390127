The Chronicle Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan has urged the country’s central bank to be prepared for the use of digital currencies. President Samia told the Bank of Tanzania on Sunday to be vigilant amid a rising interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies around the globe. “I know that many countries around the world have not accepted or started using digital currencies. However, I call upon the Bank of Tanzania to start looking into these developments just to be prepared. “We don’t want to be caught unawares or find out later that our citizens are ahead of us and have already started using cryptocurrencies,” she said. El Salvador last week became the first country in the world to officially classify a digital currency, Bitcoin, as legal currency. — BBC news
