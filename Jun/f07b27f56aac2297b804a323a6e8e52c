The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter FORMER Highlanders and Caps United winger Gabriel Nyoni is expected to go under the knife on Tuesday for the second time to correct a fractured foot. The Cape Umoya forward in the Glad Africa Championship in South Africa was first operated in February and wires and pins were used to balance the bones inside his foot. “I always hope and pray for the best. I thank the club Cape Umoya for taking good care of me and doing everything humanly possible to get me back on the field,” Nyoni tweeted ahead of the surgery. According to doctors, the Zimbabwean might not play football again. – @innocentskizoe
