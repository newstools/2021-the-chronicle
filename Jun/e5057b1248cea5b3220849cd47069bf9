AFTER being forced to abandon plans to play a Test match against Portugal on July 3 due to the European country’s coronavirus situation, the Zimbabwe senior men’s rugby team has now had to delay its departure for the Rugby Africa Cup in Tunisia due to Covid-19. The Sables had been scheduled to head out to the north African country yesterday for the Rugby Africa Cup Pool D where they will face Burkina Faso and Tunisia. Jason Maritz, the Sables team manager, said they have been informed that Tunisia is now listed under the red zone Covid-19 countries. While the Rugby Africa Cup Pool D is still going ahead, the Sables will only be allowed entry into Tunisia four days before the start of the tournament, which means they will now fly out of Harare on July 4. “The Tunisia government has moved the country into a red listed country in terms of Covid-19. The tournament is still going ahead, but the restriction of us going into Tunisia is now only four days before the tournament and we can’t go there sooner,” Maritz said. It means the Sables will continue fine tuning at Old Georgians Sports Club in Harare before they depart for Tunisia. “We are now going to have to stay in camp in Harare for the next couple of days and then we will fly into Tunisia on the 4th of July. Rugby Africa is obviously aware and they have helped manage the situation,” said Maritz. The Sables managed to play two friendly matches against Zambia in Harare early this month, but the rest of their plans were disrupted. Planned friendlies against the Welwitschias of Namibia were cancelled due to the Covid-19 situation in Namibia. The Sables had to also stop training when a sporting ban came into effect in the country on June 14. — @Mdawini_29
