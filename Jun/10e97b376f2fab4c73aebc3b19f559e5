FARMERS at Sebasa Irrigation in Gwanda anticipate a boost in production following the rehabilitation of their 65 hectare irrigation scheme which had been lying idle for several years. The scheme was rehabilitated under the Small Holder Irrigation Revitilisation Programme (SIRP) programme which was launched in November 2017 with the aim to assist the revitalisation of irrigation schemes across the nation through rehabilitation of infrastructure. It is a Government led programme funded by International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). A farmer operating from the irrigation scheme, Ms Zibusiso Nkala, said before it was rehabilitated they were farming less than 10 hectares as they could not afford to buy diesel to pump water. “We have been struggling to produce at our irrigation scheme because we couldn’t raise money for diesel to pump water from the river. There is a total of 93 farmers but some had pulled out as their efforts were in vain. Some of the crops that we planted would wilt because of water challenges. “The few farmers that remained were producing little for consumption with their families. Now that the irrigation has been rehabilitated and we are able to plant the whole 65 hectares we will be able to produce and then sell some of our products,” she said. Ms Nkala said they had planted wheat and sugar beans. She said they were preparing to harvest sugar beans. Ms Nkala said once the winter season had passed they would plant a wide variety of products. <img class="wp-image-553773 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Ms-Zibusiso-Nkala.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Ms-Zibusiso-Nkala.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Ms-Zibusiso-Nkala-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Zibusiso Nkala Another farmer operating at Sebasa Irrigation scheme, Mrs Alice Ndlovu said they will now be able to fend for their families using the income they will get after selling their produce. She said their desire was for the irrigation scheme to become a major supplier of farm produce around Gwanda and beyond. “Our hope has been restored as we now know that we will be able to feed our families and also pay school fees for our children. This project will go a long way in alleviating poverty within families that have benefitted. We would like to thank Government and the partner which financed the project for empowering us in such a great manner. We will work very hard to ensure that our irrigation scheme is self sustaining,” she said. Matabeleland South acting provincial irrigation engineer, Mr Shepard Mpotekwa said rehabilitation of Sebasa Irrigation Scheme started in 2017 under the SIRP programme with a feasibility study. He said the project cost about US$600 000. Mr Mpotekwa said the scheme draws water from Tuli River but farmers did not have the capacity to pump the water. “Under the rehabilitation programme a solar system was installed as well as pipe line to draw water from the river to the irrigation. The old canals were also replaced with new ones and ablution facilities were also constructed. Now the farmers don’t have to buy diesel or to pay electricity bills and they are guaranteed of reliable water supply. “The purpose of the SIRP programme is to ensure that farmers realise maximum production,” he said. Mr Mpotekwa said the irrigation scheme was established in 1965 and 93 households had benefitted from the project.- @DubeMatutu
