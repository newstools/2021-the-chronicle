Such a move comes as we want to promote our talent as we have realised that people don’t really buy music online due to the economic situation,” said Handy. <img class="size-full wp-image-551111" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/RS-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/RS-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/RS-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> RS The promoter added that above all, he hopes the song will teach other artistes that “unity is key” and also showcases the selected artistes’ talent in order to inspire others who want to pursue music. Handy has been very instrumental in the promotion of arts talent in Plumtree, something that is evidenced by the rise of the town’s youngsters, The Skool Kidz whose music brand is flourishing through his support. – @mthabisi_mthire
