The track is a response to rappers who look down on Bulawayo’s rap scene. It’s a warning as well to people not to underestimate the talent in the city. “Coming Faster is a trap-fusion track filled with lyrics about being proud to be hip hop artistes and growing within this line of art. As most artistes are switching to venture into genres like Amapiano and other contemporary ones, we as rappers instead are focusing on setting trends and raising the hip hop genre’s bar high,” said Yung Reece. <img class="wp-image-549780 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/yr2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/yr2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/yr2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Asaph The artiste who hails from Sizinda is known for hits that include Ugogo Onemali that featured late hip hop icon Cal Vin and Too Bad featuring Asaph and Louis Vitlane. – @mthabisi_mthire
