The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter OK Zimbabwe Limited has donated grocery vouchers worth $50 000 each to Mpilo Central Hospital medical staff whose quarters were razed down by fire two weeks ago. Thirty-nine doctors lost most of their property in the raging fire which destroyed the US$500 000 property. Doctors lost identity documents with most of them having to start afresh in acquisition of property among other things. In a statement on Sunday, OK Zimbabwe revealed that it had donated to the affected while calling on Zimbabweans to join it to assist the medical staff. “OK Zimbabwe Limited has given all affected Mpilo Hospital staff grocery vouchers worth 50 000 each. We commit to double all the donations made by our customers through our stores. “You can drop off gifts in the form of groceries and load Shop Easy cards which will be passed on to the affected Mpilo staff. Drop offs can be made at the following branches: OK Jason Moyo, OK Lobengula, OK Entumbane and OKMART,” read the statement. It said the collections will run for 10 days starting from June 4 to June 14.
