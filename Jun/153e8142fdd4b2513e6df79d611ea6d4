Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (Buz) president Joe Mujuru says they have suspended all national team training camps while engaging the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) to map the way forward. The Zimbabwe boys’ and girls’ Under-18 teams are due to travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo next month to take part in the Fiba 3X3 Under-18 Africa Cup. The Under-16 teams are set to travel to Malawi for the Afrobasket finals in August. “We had to break the Under-18 camp on Monday morning. The plan is to engage the SRC so that we can resume training. We also have the Under-16 five on five tournament in August which we have to plan for,” said Mujuru. The immediate tournament is the 3×3 tournament in DRC. This version of basketball is growing globally as an alternative to the 5 a-side and Zimbabwe is among the better sides in the region. The 3×3 format is a shorter, but more exciting version of the conventional format and is more suited for the smaller and quicker Zimbabwean ballers. Zimbabwe is among the favourites at the DRC tournament, which serves as a qualifier for the 3×3 Under-18 World Cup due later in the year. The 3X3 basketball is played with three players a side scoring in one basketball hoop. Each game is 15 minutes long or ends when one team reaches 21 points, whichever comes first.
