Prophet TB Joshua may be absent in the body, but he is present in the spirit (Colossians 2:5). Indeed, God is even more powerful at distance! “We are currently preparing for the week-long service from Monday 5th to Sunday 11th July, 2021 in honour of Prophet TB Joshua’s life and legacy. He will be laid to rest at The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations (Scoan) in Lagos, Nigeria. “All services will be broadcast live on Emmanuel TV. The services which will be open to the public will be communicated to you at the appropriate time.” TB Joshua, a popular televangelist who was as revered as he was controversial, died on June 5, a few days before his 58th birthday.
