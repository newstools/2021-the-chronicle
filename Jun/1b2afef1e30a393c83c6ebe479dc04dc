The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BARELY two months after landing his first coaching gig following his retirement, Bulawayo-born Zimiseleni Moyo is among 30 coaches attending a Caf C coaching course in Zambia. Nagging injuries forced the 35-year-old to hang up his boots in April and he was appointed assistant coach of the ambitious MC Galaxy Football Academy in Lusaka. MC Galaxy, who are in the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) Lusaka Provincial Division Three League, engaged Moyo to help them ensure they break into the Zambian topflight league in 2025. The dreadlocked former Tsholotsho FC, Motor Action and Railstars defender enjoyed more success in Zambia than in Zimbabwe, winning multiple championships with Zesco United from Ndola. He also had a good run with former Zambian champions Zanaco. Moyo started class on Monday and will finish on July 18. According to FAZ, the Caf C syllabus has been divided into two modules to improve the quality of coaches. Participants will undergo one module for 10 days, followed by a 20-day internship programme with a club that has a Caf A licenced coach. The coaches will then be handed their badges after fulfilling the number of hours recommended by Caf in theory, practical and internship, apart from reaching the pass mark of not less than 60 percent on the Laws of the game. “I’m very thankful for the empowering opportunity,” said Moyo. – @ZililoR
