A MINORITY shareholder in Zifa Bulawayo Province Division Two club Sunrise FC has been booted out for allegedly embezzling the club’s $24 000 Fifa Covid-19 relief funds. Mduduzi Cornelious Gumpo is also accused of fleecing various club directors by faking family bereavements and asking for funeral donations. According to police sources, Gumpo “confessed” in an affidavit that he owes Sunrise FC $24 000 and undertook to repay the money in three installments, starting on June 12. “I owe Sunrise Football Club the sum of $24 000. I promise to pay the first payment by the 12th of June, 2021, US$70 then the second batch by end of June 2021 and the last batch on the 16th of July, 2021,” reads Gumpo’s affidavit signed on June 7. Sources told Chronicle Sport that Sunrise majority shareholder Mkhululi Ndimande, who is based in South Africa, stripped Gumpo of his directorship of the team in which he holds a 30 percent stake. “Ndimande was hurt, disappointed and angry after learning that Gumpo had converted the Covid-19 relief funds to his own personal use. The team got nothing from the Fifa funds and it’s a huge scandal, which must naturally attract the attention of Zifa andy Fifa,” said the source. Zifa communications and competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela said while they always frown upon abuse of funds, the association has not received a report from Zifa Bulawayo Province. “The association sent those funds to its members, who then released the money to their affiliates (clubs). If those clubs did not receive the money, then they can approach Zifa Bulawayo Province and file a report and in turn Zifa Bulawayo will contact us,” said Gwesela. Gumpo initially told one of the club directors that he gave the money to a prospective sponsor, who wanted his goods transported from Harare to Bulawayo on November 24 last year. Gumpo did not respond to questions from Chronicle Sport.
