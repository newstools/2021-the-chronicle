The Chronicle Lingani Nyika, Chronicle Reporter A 21-YEAR-OLD man from Matetsi outside Victoria Falls who is being accused of having sex with a minor told a court that he never slept with the juvenile although the 14-year-old girl continuously pestered him for sex. Artwell Mathe of Masikili village under Chief Shana pleaded not guilty to having sexual intercourse with a young person and performing indecent acts with a young person. He appeared before Victoria Falls resident Magistrate Ms Lindiwe Maphosa yesterday where he pleaded guilty to fondling the girl but denied having sex with her. He was remanded out of custody on his own cognisance to Tuesday next week. Mathe told the court that the complainant at some point eloped to his home on two occasions and he took her back to her parents. The girl is doing Form Two at a local school and both live in the same area. The two allegedly had a sexual relationship starting in August 2019 until the girl’s mother caught them caressing each other in a bush and reported the matter to the police, hence the charge of performing indecent acts with a young person. Prosecuting, Mr Asher Chindedza said the complainant told her mother she had sex with Mathe. “During the month extending from August to September 2019, the accused and complainant had sexual intercourse twice with the complainant’s consent at his place of residence. The matter came to light in September 2019 when the complainant’s mother found the two in a bush in Matetsi,” said Mr Chindedza. A medical report showed that the girl had been penetrated. The court heard that Mathe proposed to the girl in August 2019 when the two met at a borehole and the two lovebirds later had sex. – @NyikaLingani
