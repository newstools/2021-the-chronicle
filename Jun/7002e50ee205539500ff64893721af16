The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Versatile musician, Master Zhoe who is touted as one of the music kingpins in Gwanda, has dropped a track titled I am Never Alone that features songstress, Cutie G. The house track which is available on a number of digital platforms unpacks how romantic relationships have turned toxic as many are now staying in relationships for material things, not love. Master Zhoe who has spread his wings nationally said the track is just the beginning of collaborations that will include internationally acclaimed artistes. “I am Never Alone is a love song about a couple that is having troubles in their relationship. The lady knows her man loves other women hence the phrase ‘I am never alone’. She finds herself in a fix as the guy has money and uses that as a trump card to get anyone he wants,” explained Master Zhoe. He said they were working on shooting visuals of the track. “We’re going to be shooting visuals of track soon. This is the start of a number of collaborations that we’ll be rolling out this year. Some will feature international artistes. “To promote artistes from my town, I decided to first collaborate with Cutie G, a former X-Studios record label member who has grown to be a very good vocalist,” said Master Zhoe. – @mthabisi_mthire
