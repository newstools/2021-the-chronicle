Popular Jazz songstress, Vuyo Brown who just launched a new single titled Imvana, is once again, using the online “Pay What You Want” model to sell the single. Through this manner, people decide how much they want to buy the music for, rather than her setting the price. In April, the Thula Wazi hit-maker used the method when she launched the single Mayeh. She said the new single is available via this platform for the next two weeks with details of how to buy the song found on her social media platforms. Giving a brief of the song, Vuyo Brown said: “Produced by Just Percy, the song is about the unconditional love of God, a love willing to sacrifice for us and a love ready to love us as we are. Imvana is a vibe and I hope many people will buy a copy as I’ve made it easy for them to do so.” She said the decision to use the Pay What You Want model came after the realisation that the traditional sales model bore little to no profit for her with all her past releases. “I launched this strategy for my music in April with the release of ‘Mayeh’ and I’m glad it was a success. The point is to sell my product and for people to actually buy it. It is also to help instill a culture of buying music among the masses.” “I also felt online streams paid too little to give any real profits unless I’d be getting streams in the millions or billions,” she said. Vuyo Brown is an award-winning singer, songwriter, and multi-genre artiste who broke into the music industry in 2016 as a contemporary Christian artist.-@mthabisi_mthire
