The Chronicle Zambia’s President Edgar Lungu has assured citizens that he is well after collapsing while attending a public event, according to a statement from his office. Mr Lungu was presiding over the national defence day on Sunday when “he experienced sudden dizziness” in the capital, Lusaka, it said.
Secretary to the Cabinet Simon Miti, who issued the statement, said that the president was “well and has continued to discharge his duties”. Dr Miti added that he recovered immediately after the incident. Mr Lungu had a similar health incident in 2015, which the presidency said was because of an “oesophagus condition”. President Lungu is seeking re-election in the 12 August polls. — BBC news
