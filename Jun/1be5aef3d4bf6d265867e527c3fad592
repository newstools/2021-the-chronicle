The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter Twelve Zimbabwean films that featured on the recent DStv Afro-Cinema pop-up channel are now available to viewers on DStv Catch Up, giving audiences in Zimbabwe and across Africa a chance to enjoy the local content that was selected for the channel’s Africa Day-related run. Liz Dziva, publicity, and public relations manager of MultiChoice Zimbabwe said the 12 films are now on Catch Up and would be available until June 30. “It was thrilling for Zimbabwe to enjoy a choice of 12 locally-made films when Afro-Cinema ran on DStv in May.
