ZIMBABWE Netball Association Bulawayo province has suspended its secretary-general Livonia Bhebhe over the Africa Day netball tournament held at Sobukhazi High School that saw teams flouting Covid-19 health guidelines. Provincial chairman Joseph Nkomazana said Bhebhe had brought the name of the association into disrepute by failing to enforce the law. “Zina Bulawayo province notes with great concern the way you have been found on the wrong side of the law when you are supposed to be the one enforcing it. You have put our association in the wrong spotlight and therefore bringing our name into disrepute. This leaves our executive with no option but to suspend you with immediate effect,” wrote Nkomazana. The letter does not state for how long Bhebhe is suspended. There was no sanitisation of players and balls as well as wearing of masks and maintenance of social distancing as required for such tournaments. It later emerged that the tournament was held without clearance from the Sports and Recreation Commission and despite her presence at the event, Bhebhe did nothing to ensure Covid-19 health protocols were observed. Instead, she distanced herself from the tournament saying she was merely a spectator. The SRC wrote to Zina Bulawayo province demanding an explanation but it could not be ascertained whether Bhebhe had submitted any report before her suspension.
