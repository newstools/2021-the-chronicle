The Chronicle KAIZER Chiefs, Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns are all interested in luring Knowledge Musona back to the DStv Premiership. The Zimbabwe captain, who turned 31 this week, is set to return to Anderlecht after his season-long loan with domestic rivals KAS Eupen where he netted seven goals in 24 league starts. Eupen’s financial struggles prevented them from making the deal permanent and while interest is now brewing for the services of the ‘Smiling assassin’, his next move is still in the hands of Vincent Kompany’s outfit. This website can confirm Musona has attracted interest from the Chinese Super League, the PSL big-three and two clubs in Belgium, but he is set to report for pre-season at the Jupiler Pro League giants. Reports in Belgium suggest Musona was one of 14 players told not to return to the club, but the players’ representative Mike Makaab has refuted the claims. “He’s going back to Anderlecht, he’s being asked to join the first week of July for training; he has one year left on his contract with them,” Makaab told KickOff.com. “I’m not sure if he will be part of the squad, we’ll have to see how things unfold. The intention is to wait and see what Anderlecht want to do. There might be interest in South Africa, in the Middle East, could be interest in China and certain parts of Europe. But the truth is we cannot be aggressively marketing Knowledge until we know exactly what Anderlecht want to do.” When pressed on whether the likes of Chiefs, Pirates and Sundowns could match his wage demands as one of the Belgian giants’ highest-earners, Makaab said: “I think it will be highly unlikely.” Musona is believed to be earning around €950 000 (R16 million) annually at his current employers where he’s only been afforded 10 games since his arrival in July 2018.— KickOff
