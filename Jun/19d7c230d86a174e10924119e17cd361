Geraldine Roche projects coordinator, Khaliphile Sibanda said the festival started off well and showed that there is need for leniency for the arts sector in terms of re-opening. “The first show was a success. Everything started on time with Covid-19 protocols of temperature checks and regular sanitisation being the order of the day. Those who attended had a great time and called for the reopening of the arts sector as they had missed watching theatre productions. <img class="wp-image-551499 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Yashar-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Yashar-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Yashar-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Yashar arts group “As a festival, we’re promising our audience, nothing but the best entertainment from these talented groups,” said Sibanda.
