THE Zimbabwe Netball Association Bulawayo provincial chairperson Joseph Nkomazana has refused to comment on the constitutional breach that saw men elected to lead the association in the province despite the constitution stating that only women should be chairpersons. Nkomazana also disputed claims that the suspension of secretary-general Livonia Bhebhe was fueled by her alleged association with the breakaway Rainbow Amateur Netball League (Ranl), which has been a thorn in the flesh for Zina since its formation in 2018. Reacting to reports that he used the Sobukhazi High School held Africa Day tournament as an excuse to get back at Bhebhe, whom he suspects to be a Ranl mole, Nkomazana stated that his secretary-general was part of the organisers. “It has nothing to do with Ranl. I think you know what happened at the tournament organised at Sobukazi High School; she was part of the organisers of the event. As secretary-general she was supposed to inform the executive about it,” said Nkomazana. He declined to comment on the contentious chairperson issue, referring Chronicle Sport to Zina national president Leticia Chipandu. “I don’t have any comment on the chairperson issue; maybe you can talk to my national president about it,” said Nkomazana. Chipandu was not reachable for comment. Netball has over the years been engulfed in controversies fueled by personality clashes among administrators and poor corporate governance, which led to the formation of the breakaway Ranl, further fueling tensions. Zina has steadfastly refused to officially recognise Ranl despite being deserted by almost all clubs to the breakaway league.
