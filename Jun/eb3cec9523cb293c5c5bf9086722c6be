The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent THERE is a 20-year-old hip hop musician from Nketa suburb in Bulawayo who has vowed to be one of the best rappers in the country and world at large. Brandon Ncube, an up-and-coming young artiste says his stage name, Trap King, defines how determined he is to be on the top league. He said he is in the process of making his dream come true. “Being a hip hop, rap and trap artiste, all I envisage is to be the best and I’m working towards achieving this through the love I have for the mic. I began doing music in 2018, but by then, I was just doing it for fun. But now, I’m very serious about this as I’m doing it to change the game,” said Trap King. Trap King said he sees himself becoming a successful musician in the coming years adding that it is his wish to redefine the perspective that the best rappers are from cheesy suburbs, and not from the ghetto. “I’m seeing myself going far through music as I’ve so far recorded five singles. I’m also in the process of working on a mixtape which I believe will change the face of kasi hip hop and prove that even from the ghetto, we can shine and be great,” he said. Trap King’s singles are Shoot, NF, Hate me or Love me and UK and Pull. – @mthabisi_mthire
