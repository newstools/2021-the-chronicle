Up-and-coming Afro-pop and Afro-fusion musician, Naison Ndlovu aka Neezy II will next Friday launch his debut EP titled Priceless as he has set his eyes on making a mark in the music scene. The EP will be availed on major online stores as the artiste is hoping to monetise his works. Neezy II said the EP has five tracks, Priceless, Ponjigo Wahala, Without You, Keep Calm and My Party. “This is my very first EP since I started doing music in 2017. It’s been a great experience thus far and with this EP, I want to make a mark,” said the enthusiastic 18-year-old artiste. In the song, Keep Calm the artiste featured a female up-and-coming musician, Sammy C in a deliberate move aimed at uplifting female artistes. He shared plans to release more works later in the year as he wants to remain relevant. Neezy II seems to be on the right track with his career as he has interacted with most influential musicians in Bulawayo including Mzoe 7, Tebza, South Africa-based La Dee and Mzistozz. “I want to thank Zimkids for sponsoring the EP as well as my manager, Mr Trent for the great work he did. “Thanks to the fans for supporting Neezy II,” he said. Last year, the artiste was signed under Muzibits Entertainment before he shifted to Trent’s management. Inspired by the sounds of Davido, Mr Eazi, Patoranking, Yemi Alade, Eazzy, Don Jazzy, Joeboy and Rema among others, the youngster said he is itching for success and growth. -@mthabisi_mthire
