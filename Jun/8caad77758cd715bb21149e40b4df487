FORMER Hwange goalkeeper Leon Mwale, who is now a businessman, has come to the rescue of the Hwange juniors’ rugby team by donating eight rugby balls. The team, coached by Hwange Diggers prop Bernard “Big Ben” Ncube, was using a single ball for its training sessions, which made life difficult for Ncube and his lieutenants. Mwale made his donation through his fashion design company Leon Fashion Empire under the Lafae label. <img class="alignnone wp-image-552452 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/pio5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/pio5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/pio5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We donated eight rugby balls, as they had only one ball, which I felt it was not adequate for the growth of the sport and the team. We are still waiting for cons to be delivered since they have already been purchased,” said Mwale, son to former Hwange goalkeeper and coach Weekly. The young entrepreneur said while he was into football, he has always been passionate about sport in general and will always continue to assist in the emancipation of sportspersons regardless which sport it is. “One reason that made me donate to rugby kids is that I value every area of sport, as long as it is junior development. I also have a junior golfer that I am sponsoring and I hope soon he is going to realise his real potential.” Mwale cut his football teeth at Hwange High School, playing alongside the likes of Method Mwanjali. Writing on its Facebook page, Leon Fashion Empire emphasised the need to always give back to the community. “No matter how great you are, if you don’t give back to the community, the community will never recognise you.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-552453 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/pio4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/pio4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/pio4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> In 2017, Hwange Diggers coach Octavia Chikukura made an impassioned plea to well-wishers for financial assistance to revamp the sports pavilion rugby pitch and also buy a playing and training kit. She said the pitch was in a sorry state and they needed a pump and motor for watering the field as well as assistance for the construction of toilets and changing rooms. Efforts by Chikukura and senior players like Ncube to nurture future stars resulted in Hwange-based players Dion Kamwendo and Kabelo Mpofu forming part of the President’s 7s side, one of Zimbabwe’s three select senior teams in the last Kwese Victoria Falls Sevens rugby tournament in 2017. Other players like Sydney Nyathi, Joseph Ndlovu, Resistance Befura, Agreement Shoko, Brandon Tshaka, Cephas Sibanda and Allian Sibanda also featured in that tournament featuring for the Hwange Under-19 developmental side.
