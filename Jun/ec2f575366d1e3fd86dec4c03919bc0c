It’s a song originally composed and sung by Black Umfolosi. I’ve loved them since I was young and I loved this song in particular, that’s why I did a rendition of it. I’m grateful to Black Umfolosi for writing such a beautiful song,” she said. Nkwali who stole the show at the Bulawayo Arts Festival said she is working on surprise projects which include visuals for the track Halala Lozikeyi that awed President Mnangagwa at the festival. – @mthabisi_mthire
