REDCLIFF Municipality has resolved to spend a huge chunk of its devolution funds towards averting perennial water challenges in the town. The town has been dogged by serious water shortages for close to a decade after the closure of Ziscosteel which used to supply the town with water. The cash-strapped local authority is struggling to pay more than $45 million it owes Kwekwe City for water supplied.
Redcliff has since engaged donors to construct its own water treatment plant as it seeks a long-lasting solution to the water challenges. In an interview, Acting Town Clerk, Mr Nyararai Gomba said the town recently received $9,6million and a huge chunk of it will be channelled towards repairing the water infrastructure as well as drilling and rehabilitating boreholes. “We seek to use devolution funds to alleviate water shortages in the town. We have used devolution funds so far to rehabilitate boreholes in Torwood, Rutendo and Simba Park so that when the water we receive from Kwekwe is not coming out of the taps, our residents get clean sources of water,” said Mr Gomba. He said the local authority’s target was to have at least a borehole in every ward. “We are starting with those boreholes that serve a lot of people in the high-density suburbs before moving to low-density suburbs,” said Mr Gomba. The council is also repairing and upgrading old water reticulation infrastructure. “We want to address the issue of water leakages hence we are rehabilitating the old water reticulation infrastructure which has outlived its lifespan,” he said. Mr Gomba said council also plans to drill boreholes at every clinic.
