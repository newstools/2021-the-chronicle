The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent SOUTH Africa-based Bulawayo-born gospel musician, Fundani Ndebele aka Fundy has challenged himself by trying out other genres with his latest two singles. The singles are Sohlabelela which is a fusion of Amapiano and traditional gospel while the other, Father of the Fatherless, is laced with reggae and gospel.  Speaking from his South Africa base, Fundy said: “I decided to work on the two singles as a way of testing my strength and I’m happy that they’re being well received. On Sohlabelela, I talk about the joy that the brethren will encounter when meeting the Lord while on Father of the fatherless, I talk about God’s love upon myself. The song also seeks to give hope to people that the pandemic will be over one-day,” said Fundy. The 27-year-old artiste who grew up under the care of a religious family started his music career in 2013 with a Bulawayo gospel group called The Wipers of Gospel. He went solo in 2014 and recorded his first gospel single titled Ngizohamba Nawe. This served as his introductory track, especially in Bulawayo and Matabeleland provinces. In 2017, Fundy relocated to South Africa in order to pursue his studies at the University of Pretoria where he is studying Media and Communications. In the same year, he released his debut album titled Backwards Never where he featured Buhle Nhlangulela, a South African gospel songstress well known by her hit song IAgenda Yezulu. In 2019 he released the single, Why Udlala Ngathi Satan. – @mthabisi_mthire
