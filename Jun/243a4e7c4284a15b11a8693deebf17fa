TWO human bones, believed to be remains of an 88-year-old granny who was reported missing last month, have been located at her homestead and police are now investigating her grandchild for suspected murder. One of the bones was allegedly found being eaten by a dog and further investigations by the police led to the discovery of another bone in the fields at the woman’s homestead in Njini Village under Chief Sogwala in Lower Gweru. Midlands provincial police spokesperson Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko said investigations into the disappearance of the granny previously reported missing led to unearthing of a suspected murder case. He said Ms Cini Bhebhe allegedly went missing on May 7 and a missing person’s report was made to the police on June 22. “The woman, Cini Bhebhe, was staying in Njini village, under Chief Sogwala in Lower Gweru. “She was staying with her grandson Proud Bhebhe (42) suspected to be mentally ill. Reported circumstances are that, Cini Bhebhe left home on May 7 intending to visit her sister in Mtabeni village under the same Chief, Sogwala,” said Insp Mahoko. Ms Bhebhe, he said, allegedly did not reach her destination and was never seen again thereafter. On Wednesday, Insp Mahoko said Ms Bhebhe’s son Never (68) reported that the family had discovered their mother’s blood stained clothes and a bone suspected to be that of a human being eaten by a dog. “Police attended the scene and during searches in the fields at the homestead, two suspected human bones were discovered. They also discovered what appeared like a shallow grave which was dug up but nothing was found inside,” he said. Insp Mahoko said the suspected human bones were taken to Maboleni police station pending examination by experts. “Proud Bhebhe is being treated as a suspect and investigations are underway. We appeal to members of the public who might have information that can help in this case to pass it to any nearest police station,” he said.
