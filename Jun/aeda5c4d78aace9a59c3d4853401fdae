He said the stories of Father Zimbabwe, the late Vice President Joshua Nkomo, King Mzilikazi, King Lobengula, Queen Lozikeyi, Umlugulu, Ginyamatshe, Mbuya Nehanda and Mukwati must be popularised. “This will go a long way, in consolidating unity, peace and social cohesion, as fundamental ingredients for nation building. I thus exhort stakeholders in the education and media fraternity as well as communities to continue playing their part in the rewriting of the correct history and bequeathing it to future generations. I commend Pathisa Nyathi for the work he has done. It will remain very useful for generations to come,” said the President. Mr Nyathi said being recognised was more fulfilling than any monetary reward. <img class="wp-image-550175 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/HE-tour-nkomo-statue-P4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/HE-tour-nkomo-statue-P4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/HE-tour-nkomo-statue-P4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa at the late Vice-President Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo statue during his tour of the Bulawayo Heritage Corridor. “It is very good to hear that someone at such a high office is in touch with what is happening on the grassroot level. It’s humbling that the work that I am doing is visible. This recognition is more rewarding than money,” said Mr Nyathi. “The President, the Vice President and a good number of his cabinet ministers spent the whole day not teaching people about politics, but for us to tell them about history, culture and heritage. This is welcome,” said Mr Nyathi. He said that was one of the reasons that he built Amagugu Heritage International Heritage Centre and has books on folktales to preserve history and culture for future generations.
