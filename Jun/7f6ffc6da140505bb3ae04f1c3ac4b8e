This will be followed by the song’s visuals which were shot in Victoria Falls. They’ll be released on the 16th of this month,” she said.

Commenting on juggling being a nurse and musician, Sandra said: “It’s difficult, but I’m managing to balance the two just well. I maximise on music when I’m not at work or in-between tasks and when I knock off. I guess what makes it easier is because I love both,” she said. – @mthabisi_mthire
