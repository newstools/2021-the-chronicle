LOCAL rugby fans will get a chance to watch the senior national rugby team’s return to action after a long layoff when they play against Zambia in two international friendlies that will be live-streamed by the Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) on its social media platforms. The first match gets underway in Harare on Wednesday with the Zimbabwe girls Under-15 and men’s Under-20 sides featuring as curtain-raisers. The next games will be played on Saturday and have been arranged to assist the two countries to prepare for the Africa Cup and 2023 Rugby World Cup qualifiers. After the two matches against Zambia, the Sables will travel to Namibia and round up their preparations with a game against South African club Blue Bulls select in the coming weeks. The Sables will head to Tunisia for the Africa Cup Pool D matches in early July after the series of friendlies. Their preparations for the continental and global tournaments were boosted by Nedbank which donated US$120 000 for the squad’s World Cup qualifying campaign. Zimbabwe last qualified for the Rugby World Cup in 1991. — @innocentskizoe
