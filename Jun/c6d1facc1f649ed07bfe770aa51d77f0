The Chronicle SUPERSPORT United have confirmed the exit of two players as they start their preparation for the 2021/22 DStv Premier Soccer League campaign. After finishing in fifth place last season Matsantsansa have wasted no time in starting their squad reshuffle as Evans Rusike (31) and Lucky Mohomi (30) are the first to officially depart. Rusike joined the club from Maritzburg United in January 2018 with a fearsome reputation, but struggled for form in his final season as he failed to find the net in 21 appearances. Mohomi’s loan with Mamelodi Sundowns expires at the end of this month and the club has opted not to make the deal permanent. “SuperSport United Football Club would like to confirm the departure of Evans Rusike and Lucky Mohomi,” the club’s statement read. “The Matsatsantsa family would like to thank Rusike and Mohomi for their contributions and wish them all the best for their future endeavours.” — KickOff
