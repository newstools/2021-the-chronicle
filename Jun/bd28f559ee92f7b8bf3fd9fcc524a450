VILLAGERS in Ndlovu outside Victoria Falls have appealed to authorities to speedily repair a bridge that was damaged by rains across Malayitha stream, on the road that links Ndlovu and Jambezi to Victoria Falls. The bridge was swept away in December and has not been repaired. During the same month a 10-year-old boy Pardon Nkosikhona Nyoni from Ndlovu drowned while swimming with two other juveniles near the bridge where a pool of water had developed as a result of the damage to the bridge. Villagers approached Zanu-PF Hwange District Co-ordinating Committee leadership and expressed concern that the damaged bridge had literally cut them off from Victoria Falls as vehicles struggle to pass through. <img class="alignnone wp-image-554821 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-11-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-11-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-11-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> They said trucks bringing food relief have to offload in the neighbouring village, forcing people to walk long distances to collect their share.
Jambezi and Ndlovu are busy business centres outside Victoria Falls. The 34km road that connects the Hwange-Victoria Falls to Jambezi, passing through to Msuna and Deka along Zambezi River, linking to Hwange is also in a bad state and needs repair. A meeting was held on Monday between the DDC leadership and villagers at Malayitha Bridge.. Mrs Musa Weza, who is also Zanu-PF chair for Kachechete ward said the community is concerned about the state of the bridge and road. “We have been appealing to authorities to repair this bridge as it is key to development in the area. We are happy that the DCC has responded and the bridge is getting attention,” she said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-554819 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-10-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-10-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-10-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DCC chairman Cde Mathew Muleya who was accompanied by the DCC Secretary for Administration and Secretary for Commissariat Cdes Nkosilathi Jiyane and Elias Muzamba, said the Ministry of Transport will next week start working on the bridge. “Government is working on developmental programmes to uplift people’s lives and this bridge is one of such projects. We have spoken to the Ministry of Transport and they are coming early this coming month and they will also gravel the whole road from the turn off to Jambezi,” said Cde Muleya. He implored community leaders especially village heads to ensure that only youths from Ndlovu are employed on the project to empower locals in line with the country’s empowerment programmes and Devolution Agenda. <img class="alignnone wp-image-554824 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-12-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-12-4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-12-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Villagers had started carrying stones to the bridge as they desperately want it fixed. Cde Muleya commended former Ndlovu councillor, Cde Martin Ndlovu who is also Hwange DCC Secretary for Legal Affairs as he has been using his vehicle to carry stones from about 10km away. — @ncubeleon
