2020 Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (BAA) Outstanding Literary Work — Fiction winner Yvonne Maphosa is set to release a novel titled Heart-in-Two in September that will tackle entanglements. This is set to be a thrilling book taking note of how the phrase “entanglement” was popularised by Jada Pinkett-Smith after her Red Table Talk interview last year where she admitted having cheated on Will Smith with August Alsina in what she described as an entanglement. The South Africa-based novelist who is currently in Zimbabwe said she will charm her fans with her latest offering. “Heart-in-Two is a story not to miss out on as it’s of a girl juggling two dangerous guys. She’s dicing with death and she knows it, but she’s so torn between them. “She doesn’t know how to stop —or perhaps she doesn’t want to stop. Because when she extracts the qualities she likes from both of them, she has her dream man,” said Maphosa. She said the storyline gets interesting when the girl is confronted with the true colours of her lovers. “It gets interesting when the true colours of the men are revealed and she resorts to lying her way out of situations. This is an entanglement-love story. I love entanglements because that’s how it is in the real world. “More lovers out there are dribbling or being dribbled, it’s the order of love these days,” said Maphosa. Other novels Maphosa has penned include The Y in Your Man is Silent Book 1 & 2, Grasping At Straws Book 1 & 2 and Grasping At Straws that clinched the BAA award. – @mthabisi_mthire
