VICTORIA Falls’ multi-denominational gospel group, Voice of Worship (Vow), is appealing for support from residents and council as members believe they have what it takes to put the resort city’s music on the map . Formed in 2018 by Tinashe Kuda Murapa, Vow which is crafted in the mould of Zimpraise and Joyous Celebration, sings in different languages. The group’s members are mostly school pupils and school leavers. Recently the group invited selected individuals for a concert that was held at Avril Guest lodge and recorded 12 songs that they want to use to introduce themselves. The songs are Ntate ke mang, Uma Simdumisa, Loduma, You handle me well, Igama lakho, Jonah, Fumaneka kuwe, Tirivawadzani, Baba wethu, Ndiye Jesu, Nkazimulo, Togara naye and Nkazimulo. Most of the songs were written by the group’s members while some were taken from other churches and renowned musicians. Commenting after the concert, Murapa bemoaned lack of support. He said it is disheartening that the group is expected to pay for things such as venues yet most members are unemployed. “We have a challenge of access to facilities as we’re expected to pay to use venues despite the fact that most of our members are school pupils and unemployed school leavers. We are therefore appealing to council and residents to assist us. Council could avail facilities for our use for free just like what it is doing for political meetings,” said Murapa. He said the community should also support the group’s music as the group’s goal is to provide a platform to mentor kids and give life guidance. “We want to make Victoria Falls the number one gospel music city as there’s potential to produce great musicians here,” said Murapa. The songs they recorded, Murapa said, will be uploaded on all Vow social media platforms. He said Vow is unique because its members are drawn from different denominations and backgrounds. — ncubeleon.
