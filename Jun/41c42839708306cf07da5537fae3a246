The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter JUNIOR football resumption in Bulawayo remains a pipedream after only Zifa registered academies were greenlighted by the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) to start training in preparation for league games. There are 39 registered academies in Zimbabwe, but only Bantu Rovers Academy is based in Bulawayo, with a majority located in Harare. The Bulawayo academy is run by Wilbert Sibanda. The thumbs up was given on Tuesday. “All academies that are registered with Zifa have been cleared to start training,” said Zifa communications and competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela. Ellita Nengomasha, the SRC director of marketing and business development also confirmed to Chronicle Sport that the country’s supreme sports body had cleared football academies to resume training ‘as part of the gradual resumption of football in the country’. Gwesela said those not on the list of approved academies either chose not to register or are not in good standing in terms of academy registration criteria.
