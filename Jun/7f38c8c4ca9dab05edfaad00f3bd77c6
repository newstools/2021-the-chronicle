The company has procured a state-of-the-art equipment and will be producing more than 32 000 carrier bags per day from plastic waste. Located in Westondale industrial area along Khami Road, the project has excited environmentalists who say this will assist the city to manage plastic waste in a sustainable manner. Chasdiel Investment is the parent company of Anytime Plastics that also produces toilet papers and peanut butter. In an interview company official, Mr Tonderai Maguraushe said the Bulawayo the company was already distributing its products throughout the country. The company expects to have completed installation of its machinery by the third quarter of this year, which will see the business increasing its capacity utilisation from 80 percent to 100 percent. “We started operating on 1 March this year following the setting up of our new plant.

Mr Maguraushe urged residents to collect waste plastic for recycling as this was their raw material. “From waste plastic, we produce mini-carrier bags, medium carrier bags, refuse bags, taxi bags and meat bailers. “We buy the waste paper from residents, collect from supermarkets, streets, industries and homes,” he said. Bulawayo Environmental Management Agency (Ema) provincial manager, Mrs Sithembisiwe Ndlovu, applauded the setting up of the waste recycling company saying the project was critical in tackling waste. She was speaking during a recent media tour of the company. “I think if we all manage to separate our waste and recycle what is recyclable instead of a lifespan of 40 years for the landfill it can go up to 50 years,” said Mrs Ndlovu. — @themkhust.
