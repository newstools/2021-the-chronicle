The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter Highlanders 1-0 Bulawayo City HIGHLANDERS’ players put aside their salary grievances to deservedly collect maximum points against municipal side Bulawayo City in a Chibuku Super Cup match at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday. Bosso, who only trained twice, on Tuesday and Saturday, for the match, secured victory through an 85th minute spot kick converted by goalkeeper and captain Ariel Sibanda. The resultant penalty came after striker Washington Navaya was brought down in the box by City defender Douglas Sibanda in the 81st minute. It took four minutes for the penalty to be taken as City players contested referee Hardly Ndazi’s decision and when it was eventually taken, Sibanda put the ball beyond the reach of City goalie Bhekimpilo Ncube. “It was a game that we said to ourselves as players we need to focus on and win, then get back to the issue of our salary demands. It’s good that we won to stay in contention to defend our title,” said Bosso skipper Sibanda. Highlanders could have wrapped up the match in the first-half when Ray Lunga went for a cheeky chip, which was, however, brilliantly saved by Ncube in the fifth minute. So dominant were Highlanders that one wouldn’t believe that they didn’t train for three days in a row due to the players’ industrial action. Bosso players looked fit and pressed City, forcing three corner kicks inside the first 20 minutes. Nayava then fluffed a brilliant scoring chance in the 20th minute by shooting straight into the hands of Ncube after being set-up by Lunga. In the 28th minute, City’s Crispen Machisi weaved his way past a cluster of Bosso players before sending a tantalising cross, but there were no takers. City hardly troubled Bosso and the Bulawayo giants had a sharp shooter, they could have won by a more convincing score line. – @ZililoR
