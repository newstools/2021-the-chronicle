FORMER Highlanders and Caps United winger Gabriel Nyoni has had screws and pins removed from the left foot he fractured in the South African Glad Africa Championship in February. This was the speedy forward’s second surgery since suffering the injury. The Cape Umoya forward was first operated in February and wires and pins were used to balance the bones inside his foot. “My rehab might take plus or minus nine months. So basically, I will just have to wait and see and patiently go through the process. I am excited that the surgery went well,” said Nyoni. Nyoni joined Cape Umoya in September last year from DStv Premier Soccer League side Maritzburg United, who offloaded him due to constant injury lay-offs. A holder of a degree in marketing from the National University of Science and Technology (Nust), Nyoni is still hoping he can still make a return to the game possibly with Highlanders or any other local club for a swansong season before he calls time on his career. — @innocentskizoe
