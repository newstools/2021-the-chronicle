THE Footballers Union of Zimbabwe (FUZ) has intervened in the ongoing impasse over salary increments between Highlanders’ players and the executive committee. FUZ president Desmond Maringwa spent the whole of yesterday in a series of meetings with players’ representatives and the executive in a bid to find a solution to the standoff that saw players staging three sit-ins at training for three days last week and threatening not to fulfill last Sunday’s Chibuku Super Cup match against Bulawayo City. The players ended up training at a private school on Saturday and eventually fulfilled Sunday’s game after persuasion by the technical staff, and went on to win 1-0. Chronicle Sport yesterday observed a full contingent of the Bosso first team players going through their paces under the guidance of fitness trainer Harold Nhachi and the watchful eyes of head coach Mandla Mpofu and his assistant Bekithemba Ndlovu. On Tuesday, the players changed into their training gear, but refused to do any gym training session citing non-attendance to their demands. Bosso officials were unavailable to shed more light on the outcome of yesterday’s meeting. — @innocentskizoe
