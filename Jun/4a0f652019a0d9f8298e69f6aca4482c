In line with Africa Agenda 2063, which is the continent’s blueprint and master plan for transforming Africa into the global powerhouse of the future, President Mnangagwa said enhancing regional integration would assist Africa in meeting global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). “At the heart of Pan Africanism lies the values of unity, solidarity and common purpose. “These must continue to be forced as we consolidate the independence of Africa towards the realisation of shared development and prosperity for all our people,” he said. Agenda 2063 is the continent’s strategic framework that aims to deliver on its goal for inclusive and sustainable development and is a concrete manifestation of the pan-African drive for unity, self-determination, freedom, progress and collective prosperity.
