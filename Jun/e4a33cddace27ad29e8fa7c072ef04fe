The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent DANCEHALL/AFRO-POP musician-cum-producer Zuzland Master has big plans as he is working on projects that he is confident will lead him to international acclaim. Zuzland Master (born Ronald Tinashe Zuze) is known for producing Ti Gonzi’s hit track Ndangariro which is laced with motivational messages. The 23-year-old dancehall artiste said he is slowly coming out of his shell and making known his works in an industry he joined in 2015. “I’m a musician, videographer and music producer for hip hop, trap, afro pop, dancehall, RnB and Amapiano. I feel the time is now for me to combine my talents and churn out amazing works. “My wish is to lift the country’s flag high in order for us to get recognised in the worldwide music sector on platforms that include BET Awards, Grammy Awards, Oscar Awards and African Awards,” he said. “I want to leave a big legacy and give my offspring and their families a great name that they can develop, learn and benefit from,” said the up-minded artiste. Zuzland Master has five single collections and four albums under his belt. The albums are Ndozvatinoita (2017), My Heart Says (2018), SuperStar (2019) and Unbreakable (2020). “I’m working on an EP called Planet Feelings and some videos that are going to be mind-blowing. The dream to be an artiste came when I was a young boy as I enjoyed entertaining people during school days. I also used to be a dancer. “I then discovered that I was talented so I decided to do what I’m best at,” said Zuzland Master. So far, Zuzland Master seems to be on the right track as he has been interviewed on South African station Mams FM, shared the stage with the likes of Takura, Union 5, Lady Squanda, Kinnah, Ninja Tee of the Gafa family, Forest Wurld from SA, Holy Ten, Madiz.
