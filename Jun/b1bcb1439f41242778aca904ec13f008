THE Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe (IDBZ) yesterday handed over a solar-powered borehole water system to Shashane Adventist Primary School in Matobo District in Matabeleland South province. The project is part of the bank’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative. The bank drilled a 120-metre-deep solar powered borehole and installed a 5 000 litre water tank. The project was funded to the tune of US$17 000 and was completed recently. IDBZ deputy board chairman, Dr Khuphukile Mlambo handed over the project to the school authorities during a brief event, which was witnessed by the bank’s chief executive officer, Mr Thomas Zondo Sakala, senior bank executives, locals that included district education officers. Shashane Primary was established by the Seventh Day Adventist Church but operates independently from the church. It has an enrolment of 260 pupils, 55 percent of whom are girls. The school has seven teachers and five student teachers. Dr Mlambo, who is also Deputy Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor and a former pupil at Shashane Primary where he did his first grade in 1968, applauded the IDBZ for assisting the school saying water supply has been a challenge from their time. School head, Mr Petros Nyathi, said the project would ease hassles suffered in accessing water in a rural setting and help reduce exposure to water-borne diseases. He also said the school was keen to venture into successful horticulture production and transform the school into a mini-boarding facility. Mr Zondo Sakala said the project should enable pupils to engage in agricultural activities as well as improve staff retention.
