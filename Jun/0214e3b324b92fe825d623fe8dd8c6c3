THE Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe (TSCZ) has donated 41 blankets to Mpilo Central Hospital healthcare workers who recently lost property and personal belongings when a fire razed their hostel. The raging fire destroyed property worth US$500 000 and most of it belonged to 39 doctors who were housed at the hostel. Doctors lost identity documents and they have to start afresh to buy clothes as well as household property. TSCZ acting director of operations Mr Ernest Machena said the donation was part of the organisation’s social responsibility as health care workers play a crucial role in saving accident victims. “On behalf of TSCZ board of directors and staff members, we are here to offer help to our colleagues who play a major role in saving lives which is also a key area for our organisation. Now that it’s winter we realised that blankets are a need and we decided to get at least one blanket for every affected person,” said Mr Muchena. Dr Meshack Ruwende who represents the affected doctors thanked TSCZ saying the kind gestures were encouraging. “We are grateful for the help that we continue to receive from members of the public, business community and organisations like TSCZ which has given us blankets. It is good to know that we have people who are concerned about our warmth since we are in winter,” said Dr Ruwende. — @thamamoe
