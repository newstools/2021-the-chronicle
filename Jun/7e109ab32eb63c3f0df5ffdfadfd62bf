AWARD-WINNING afro-pop band, Ngoma Ingoma, have resumed working on their second album that will be a follow-up to their debut album, Ngoma Ingoma that was recorded live at The Place restaurant in Bulawayo in 2019. The second album which is yet to be named is set to have about 10 tracks. It will feature one of the country’s finest rappers, Asaph. Ngoma Ingoma started working on the album last year in February but were interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic which forced them to suspend the recording. The success of the seven-member group’s debut album set the bar high for the group which has to ensure it produces an even better product. Most fans will be keen to see if the group will be able to surpass their debut album which had hit songs such as Amalobolo which was named Song of the year at the 2019 Skyz Metro FM Awards.  The group’s spokesperson, bass guitarist Blessing Stot said they were going all out with the forthcoming album which will be accompanied by videos. “We’re in the studio doing final touches to our second album. We’ve been in the studio for months now perfecting this offering and we are confident people will love it. “The album will have 10 tracks or more with one of them featuring Asaph. We’ve maintained our diversity in this project from the mbira sound to the modern fusion of our traditional Zimbabwe sound and the other genres,” said Stot. He said some of the new album’s tracks include Inxeba, Feel the Rhythm, Ndoda Rudo and Baba naMai. Ngoma Ingoma has Stot who is the bass guitarist and also does vocals, Tiyelani Chauke (keyboard and vocals), Samuel Siwela (lead guitarist and lead vocals), Obey Mudiwa (drummer), Prince Joel Nyoni (auxiliary keyboards and vocals), Carlos Jiri (percussion and lead vocals) and De Lukes (mbira and lead vocals). — @mthabisi_mthire.
