Up-and-coming fine artist, Mchasisi Ncube aka Mchacc is remembering fallen national hero, Joshua Nkomo through a drawing which he will release on July 1, the day Father Zimbabwe died. Nkomo, an independence fighter who helped shake off colonial rule in then Southern Rhodesia, died at the age of 82. He was Vice President of Zimbabwe. Hailing from Plumtree, Mchacc who started drawing recently said he wants to make his breakthrough by honouring a hero who played a pivotal role in getting black people recognised and respected. “I’ve always been passionate about drawing since I was young. I didn’t attend any art school but I feel the time for me to showcase my drawing skills is now when the country is preparing to commemorate Dr Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo’s death. <img class="wp-image-553125 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/lala-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/lala.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/lala-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> WORK IN PROGRESS: Mchacc’s drawing of the late Father Zimbabwe Joshua Nkomo “I’ll be doing this through a drawing of Dr Nkomo. I chose him because he was a central player in the drama of Zimbabwean nationalism, which evolved from mild civil resistance in the 1950s and 1960s to a bloody guerrilla war in the 1970s that left 40 000 dead. This is an achievement of all times and his spirit should relive in us,” said Mchacc. He said his drawing will not be once-off as he wants to contribute to the development of the country’s arts sector, especially visual art through his well-crafted drawings. “My hope, if all goes according to plan, is to have an art studio that I’ll use to promote my works. The plan is to grow my brand in order to uplift the rainbow province where I come from. “I also intend to use fine art as a source of income and I believe it’s highly possible as drawing is something that I’m really passionate about.” -@mthabisi_mthire.
