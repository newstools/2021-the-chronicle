HIGHLANDERS and Dynamos have been drawn in the same group in the Marvelous Nakamba Foundation (MNF) inaugural Under-17 tournament to be staged in Bulawayo next week. The two sides are in Pool A, which also includes Njube Spurs and Manicaland Juniors. Pool A matches will be held at White City Stadium. Pool B comprises Ajax Hotspurs, Chicken Inn, Hwange Dynamo and Bulawayo City, and their games will be at Luveve Stadium. The tournament was officially launched at a function held at a city hotel yesterday. Speaking at the function, MNF chief executive officer Brian Moyo said all teams must be in Bulawayo on Friday next week for the players to undergo Covid-19 testing and attend a life skills workshop. “As MNF we are still a baby and can only get better from here. We are grateful to Nakamba, as the young man has decided to give back to the community in the same manner that he was discovered. This year we were encouraged by the return of football the world over, albeit without fans. By March, we had sent our proposal to Zifa and they helped us a lot together with the Sports and Recreation Commission. We are grateful to Zifa and the Government for allowing us to hold this tournament,” said Moyo. Zifa Bulawayo Province chairman Francis Ntuta, said: “As Bulawayo Province we have cured the cancer of age cheating and l hope we maintain that in this tournament.”
