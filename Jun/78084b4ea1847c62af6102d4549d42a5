PSL clubs were told that they can only resume training to complete their Chibuku Super Cup games after conducting Covid-19 tests in the presence of PSL medical committee doctors. The Government gave permission for completion of the Chibuku Super Cup, which had been been halted when all sports were banned last week due to a rise in Covid-19 cases. Bosso and Chicken Inn conducted their tests at Barbourfields Stadium, while Chiefs did theirs at Hartsfield Ground. – @ZililoR
