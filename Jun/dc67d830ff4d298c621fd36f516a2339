THE Chibuku Super Cup Group B encounter between Highlanders FC and Bulawayo City FC hangs in the balance if the Bosso players make good their threat not to fulfil the fixture after boycotting training for a second straight day yesterday. Bosso players are demanding that the club honours its promise of an upward review of their wages. <img class="wp-image-550299 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-18.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-18.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-18-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Executive members led by chairman Johnfat Sibanda (fourth from right) observe from a distance Similar to when they staged their first industrial action on Thursday, yesterday the players arrived at the training ground and changed into their training gear, but refused to train. When a Chronicle Sport crew arrived at the team’s training base, White City Stadium B-Arena, Bosso chairman Johnfat Sibanda, his deputy Modern Ngwenya, treasurer Donald Ndebele and chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube, were seen caucusing before being joined by club captains. Sources said the skippers were briefed on efforts the club was making to address their concerns. An anonymous donor reportedly pledged to assist with “keep goings” so that the players train for tomorrow’s encounter. However, the players refused to train, saying they will only do so after receiving an allowance. While the Bosso camp was trying to quell its in-house fires, their opponents tomorrow City were busy training for the match at the White City Stadium main arena. City are searching for their first win of the competition, and with Highlanders’ players missing two days of training, the municipal side will fancy their chances against Bosso. <img class="wp-image-550302 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-19.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-19.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-19-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bosso’s Sunday opponents Byo City trained at the same venue as if nothing was happening Highlanders are second on the Group B log standings, tied on four points with leaders Chicken Inn, who have a superior goal difference.
