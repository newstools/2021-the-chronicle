The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent LEGENDARY artiste, Thabo Nkomo is in the process of tapping into the digital space as he is uploading his former works that date back to the early 2000s on his social media platforms. Earlier this week, Nkomo uploaded his fourth album, Silamulele Baba, which was released in 2014. The next album to be uploaded will be the 2008 one titled Not Guilty Nkosi which features Iyasa. Nkomo has six albums under his belt – Vula umnyango (2000) Amagugu Amatsha (2005), Not Guilty Nkosi (2008), Silamulele baba (2014), Truth and Love (2017) and Umoya Wami (2021). He said he was inspired to upload his works on social media platforms in order to keep his legacy alive. “People keep asking for my songs so I thought it best to upload them online. I hate selling hard copies because your hard work will end up being sold for R10 in the streets and pavements of Joburg,” he said. “The first album to be uploaded was the 2014 one and I’m now in the process of putting all my music on social media platforms as technology is the way to go,” said Nkomo. – @mthabisi_mthire
