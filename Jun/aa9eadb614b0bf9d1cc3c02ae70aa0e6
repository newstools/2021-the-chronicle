The 97-year-old is one of the last surviving figures from Africa’s anti-colonial struggle of the 1950s. He became Zambia’s first president in 1964. <img class="wp-image-551953 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Press-statement.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Press-statement.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Press-statement-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Press Statement The statement says that Dr Kaunda is “requesting all Zambians and the international community to pray for him as the medical team is doing everything possible to ensure that he recovers”.
