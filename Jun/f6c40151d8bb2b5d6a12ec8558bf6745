AN increase in Covid-19 infections has thrown the sports industry off the track, following suspension of all sporting activities by the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC). The SRC complied with the Government’s directive aimed at containing a Covid-19 surge after Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga, who is also Health and Child Care Minister, announced a ban on all gatherings, except for funerals, on Saturday. The sports industry had been enjoying a gradual restart of activities under stringent conditions without fans. SRC said all sporting activities have been suspended indefinitely. “All national sports associations, clubs, gyms and related stakeholders should abide by this suspension without exception. The Sports Commission is well aware of certain ongoing, or contemplated, national sports commitments (including qualifiers for international events) and will be in urgent direct communication with the relevant national associations thereof on guidance, and other mitigatory measures, in light of the above suspension,” the SRC said in a statement announcing the suspension. Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) president Aaron Jani said their plans to restart domestic rugby have now been derailed. <img class="wp-image-552085 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Aaron-Jani.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Aaron-Jani.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Aaron-Jani-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Aaron Jani SRC issued its statement when Jani was already in Bulawayo to assist the province apply for clearance to resume activities. “The idea obviously was to restart rugby, but now with the new statutory instrument (SI) that has come through, it has thrown those plans out completely. Provinces were at different stages of preparations, with Harare Metropolitan leading the pack, as they had managed to test a good number of players. They had also managed to get a stadium approved and all the equipment done. We had applied on behalf of Harare for the final stage last week and we were hoping to do the same for Bulawayo this week,” said Jani. Jani will be touring Hartsfield Grounds this morning. Zifa spokesperson Xolisani Gwesela said: “We’ve read that SRC has suspended football activities and we abide by that while engaging the supreme sports body.” <img class="wp-image-552083 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Xolisani-Gwesela.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Xolisani-Gwesela.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Xolisani-Gwesela-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Xolisani Gwesela The Chibuku Super Cup, which had been progressing well, has also been halted. Women’s football that was set to kick-off next weekend is now frozen. The latest development means the restart of lower league football will now take longer. Zimbabwe Golf Association (ZGA) vice-president Martin Chikwana described the latest development as a “tremendous drawback” to the sport. <img class="wp-image-552087 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Martin-Chikwana.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Martin-Chikwana.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Martin-Chikwana-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Martin Chikwana “National competitions which allow people to play and pick up points that contribute to the order of merits, making one eligible for national team selection, had started. If people put clubs down, it will take time to get their groove back. “However, we appreciate what the Government is doing to save lives because life is more important than any sport. Our hope is that the Government sits down and looks at certain sport codes and grant them permission to continue their activities if they don’t pose a risk of spreading Covid-19,” said Chikwana. Zimbabwe Cricket announced suspension of the four-day match between Zimbabwe A and South Africa A pending clarification by the SRC.
In a statement, ZC said: “Following a directive to suspend all sporting activities as part of the latest Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. We have temporarily put on hold all cricket activities, including the four-day match between Zimbabwe A and South Africa A pending an appeal.” ZC has since appealed to the Government to complete the four-day match against South Africa that began on Sunday. ZC also asked to be permitted to continue with preparations for other international assignments that it had already committed to. Bangladesh are scheduled to tour Zimbabwe for a full series consisting of one Test, three one-day internationals and three twenty20 internationals next month. While the Test match will be played at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo, Harare Sports Club will play host to the white-ball segment of the tour. — @ZililoR
