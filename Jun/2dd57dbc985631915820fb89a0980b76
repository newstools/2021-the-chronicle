Musician, Helen Nyati said working with other female artistes showed that through unity, they can achieve more. “It was great working alongside other ladies in cleaning our city. It was empowering and it motivated other people to want to work with us so as to live in a clean place.” Said Novuyo Seagirl: “The event went well and it was great working with other ladies in making a positive change in our city. More activities like this are crucial. If we continue to work together like this, our future can be bright.” Mimmie Takurwana said: “It was a good experience and we learnt a lot from each other as young female artistes. Through this initiative, we managed to empower each other. I really loved the concept as I love giving back to the community.” Divas in Action Zimbabwe is a group of female artistes, both established and up-and-coming.
