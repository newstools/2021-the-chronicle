The Chronicle Algeria’s ministry of communications says that the accreditation of France 24 has been cancelled. The move comes a day after parliamentary elections were held in Algeria. A government spokesman said that the French international television news channel had shown clear and repeated hostility towards Algeria and its institutions. The turnout for the election was registered at around 30% – the lowest for two decades. Official results are due in the coming days, but the Islamist MSP has claimed that its candidates are leading in most regions. – BBC news
