SOUTH Africa-based rhumba outfit, Magwaba and The Pioneers who have roots in Makaza Village, Tsholotsho, are raising the area’s flag high as their music is being played on the neighbouring country’s radio stations, among them Phalaphala FM and Ligwala FM. The group which was formed by Christopher Moyo is basking in the glory of their second album titled Ucakide Sechelesile that was released in November last year. The album has tracks, Ucakide Sechelesile, Kuphilwa Njani?, Inzwabethi, Iphupho, Amapioneers, Amahlathi, Dadewethu and Umafikajwayele. Magwaba and The Pioneers has members, Christopher Moyo (lead vocalist), Bekimpilo “Mfanomncane” Ncube (rhythm guitarist), Nkathazo Ndlovu (bass guitarist and sub rhythms), Mafios Ndlovu (drums) and Casper Mbilini Moyo (publicist). Christopher Moyo said they are overwhelmed by the support that they are getting from their fans abroad. He said they hope this appreciation crosses over to their home country. “Our second album has become an instant hit here in South Africa, which is a great move for our group’s career. It’s always been my dream to be recognised in the music sector and the support I’m getting shows we’re in the right direction,” said Moyo. Due to this support, Moyo said they are now in studio working on a new single that will further elevate the group. “The single will detail why I ventured into music professionally, which is the passion for music. Already, fans say my music opens their minds and with that in mind, I’ll keep churning out quality music that will continue to motivate them.” — @mthabisi_mthire.
