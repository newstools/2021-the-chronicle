The Chronicle Prosper Ndlovu recently in Victoria Falls
ZIMBABWE will utilise its tenure at the helm of the Pan African Postal Union (PAPU), a specialised agency of the African Union, to spearhead the transformation of the sector and enhance its adaptability to new technologies in line with the digital revolution. The country has taken over the chairmanship and secretariat of the agency following the conclusion of the 39th Ordinary Session of the PAPU Administrative Council and 10th Ordinary Session of the elective Plenipotentiary Conference, which ended Saturday morning in the resort city of Victoria Falls. This saw Zimbabwe’s Postmaster General, Mr Sifundo Chief Moyo, being elected new PAPU secretary general uncontested. The Minister of ICT, Postal and Courier Services, Dr Jenfan Muswere, is also the new chairman of the regional organisation for the next four years. Despite fierce debate, which stretched beyond midnight on Friday among regional members who disagreed on the eligibility of some countries, candidates and voting criteria, Zimbabwe emerged victorious. Prior to the conference the country’s candidature had been endorsed by Sadc. Through Mr Moyo, with full support from the Government, the country had cast a comprehensive manifesto in which it outlined its vision of driving value creation for all PAPU members. “The renewal and relevance agenda for PAPU will re-energise PAPU to lead African posts’ adaptability to new technologies, digitalisation, migration to e-post services and operation of e-commerce platforms and financial inclusion for the benefit of citizens, MSMEs, corporates, other stakeholders and governments,” reads part of the manifesto. “This would be achieved through deep strategic collaboration, astute engagement of stakeholders, intensive resource mobilisation and utilisation, consistent programme implementation and interactive information management, benchmarking and twinning arrangements.” This message was strongly articulated by President Mnangagwa in his official opening remarks on Friday where he stressed the need for Africa to move in unison towards realising a common destiny. Through embracing Pan African values of unity, peace and solidarity, the President reiterated the need to advance regional integration efforts as a key to achieving sustainable development of the continent. <img class="wp-image-554366 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Mr-Sifundo-Chief-Moyo-1-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Mr-Sifundo-Chief-Moyo-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Mr-Sifundo-Chief-Moyo-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Sifundo Chief Moyo During deliberations, participants emphasised the need for PAPU to lead the way in helping postal players in adapting to the “new normal” of providing services virtually and remotely through digital and electronic platforms. Zimbabwe is already making strides in harnessing digital opportunities and was recently commended by the World Bank for driving digital economy inclusion. In view of the global onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country has emphasized the need for collective efforts to relentlessly fight the pandemic from all ends. The new role as the leader of the regional postal services sector, thus, empowers the country to prioritise shaping PAPU to become a transformative champion for repositioning the massive postal institutions, said Mr Moyo. This would ensure efficient and seamless connection of African citizens to local, regional and global markets, he added. A revitalised PAPU is expected to go a long way in supporting key trade and logistics needs of the continent, whose urgency has been amplified by the operationalisation, in January this year, of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). “I will ensure that PAPU is fine-tuned to be forward-looking on innovation, responsive to member States’ needs, operate in an accountable and transparent manner and promote the rich Africa, cultural, religious and linguistic diversity,” said Mr Moyo in his pledge. The mandate extends to facilitating fulfilment of Africa Agenda 2063 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In his closing remarks, Dr Muswere said Zimbabwe was humbled by the election and was committed to serve the region to its utmost ability. He said the country would work closely with other regional agencies to propel Africa’s development and realisation of its grand vision. “We stand for the protection of the sanctity of the Pan African vision that underlines our constitutional order and existence,” said Dr Muswere. “I implore us all as the PAPU family to remain vigilant to ensure the relevance of the post in the ultimate goal of a digital economy for Africa as enunciated in the AU Agenda 2063 blueprint.” The pursuit of the digital transformation agenda is strongly expressed in the National Development Strategy (NDS1), a five-year policy blueprint that builds the momentum towards an upper middle-income economy by 2030. Under this strategy, the digital economy is one of the 14 underpinning national priorities for the period 2021-2025.
