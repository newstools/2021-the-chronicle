DRIVEN by the need to develop her art, actress, Queen Noe (real name Nondulo Ngwenya) is a woman on a mission of making her name known while promoting talent from the Matabeleland region. The actress from Gwanda who ventured into the film industry professionally in 2017 is known for her role as Mastanda on Madlela comic. Having resided in South Africa for a while and shelved her acting career to focus on family and other businesses, the actress is now back in the country to pursue her career. Hitting the ground running, she recently took part in the inaugural Miss Gwanda Culture as the pageant’s host where she showed her prowess on the mic. “I’ve always loved acting since my high school days. I got my break when I acted on Madlela’s skits as Mastanda and on Bafo as Nomvula. After that, I got nominated for the Bulawayo Arts Awards in 2017. “However, I had to take a break from the arts scene in order to focus on work and a small business as I’m a mother of two,” said Queen Noe. Queen Noe who said acting runs in her veins said she is back in the country to help grow the film/TV industry. Showing her commitment, she has secured a role on popular comedian, Madam Boss’ husband — Ngoni Munetsiwa’s fast-growing drama titled Muntu kaMhofu that is airing on the Talent Hub Facebook page. “My decision to return home was due to the need to pursue my art career. Acting is something I love so I desperately needed to pursue this passion. I’m glad to be working with Ngoni Munetsiwa on Muntu kaMhofu, a drama skit that’s all about fun and the daily happenings in life from love relationships to people’s way of living. “This is a good platform for me as it’s exposing me to diverse audiences thereby boosting me as I want to penetrate the arts scene,” she said. So far, two episodes of Muntu kaMhofu have been aired and it is quite an interesting production due to the energy from the cast. — @mthabisi_mthire.
