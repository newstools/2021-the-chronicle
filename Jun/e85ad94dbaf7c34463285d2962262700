The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter NELSON Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa will host the 2021 Cosafa Cup draw on Thursday. The 12-team tournament has been earmarked for July 7-18 and is making a return after the 2020 edition was cancelled as part of the regional bloc’s measures to help fight spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The draw will be live on Cosafa’s website www.cosafa.tv from 11am. Cosafa announced that the competition will take on a new format this year, with the 12 teams being split into three groups of four teams each to ensure each side plays a minimum of three matches.
