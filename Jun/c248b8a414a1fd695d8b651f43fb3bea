The qualifiers will mark the return to competitive club volleyball since March last year. Teams will be grouped according to regions and winners from each region advance to the finals set for Gweru. Harare, Mashonaland East and Mashonaland Central teams will be based in Harare, while Gweru will play host to Mashonaland West and Midlands sides, with Manicaland teams setting up base in Masvingo. Bulawayo will host teams from Matabeleland North and Matabeleland South.

Last week, the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) invited clubs that wish to take part in the national competition to register with their provincial associations.  – @innocentskizoe
