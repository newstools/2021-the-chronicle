Chapepa had gotten the better of 15-year-old Egyptian Joody Elkady 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 in the first-round of the tournament. Tournament director Cliff Nokwara said the competition was a huge platform for young players to improve their international rankings. “This a developmental competition. It’s a huge opportunity for our young players aged between 13 and 18 years to get international exposure and international rankings they so desire. Previously our players have been forced to travel beyond the borders to play for ITF rankings. But now Cranrid is making it possible for us to host this type of event here in Zimbabwe,” said Nokwara. – @innocentskizoe
