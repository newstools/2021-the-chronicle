The Chronicle Locadia Mavhudzi, Midlands Correspondent Gweru-based musician, Tinomutenda Chihora has released an album, The fabrics of humanity, as a way to inculcate cultural values in the lives of the young generation while also celebrating traditional practices. Chihora, a music teacher at Cecil John Rhodes School in Gweru, said his latest album was motivated by the realisation that young people’s cultural values and heritage were being threatened by Westernisation. The 13-track album features songs, Tinaishe Jesu, Handina Kuzvidawo, Tree planting, Hatch up and Attention. One of the songs, Sadza nedovi has become a hit song on local radio stations because of its catchy lyrics. <img class="alignnone wp-image-549799 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/uik1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/uik1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/uik1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Sadza nedovi is a celebration of our traditional foods prepared by our grandparents and how such delicacies have kept us healthy. I am also inspired by the fact that the first lady, Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa is on a national mission to restore the culture of eating traditional foods,” Chihora said. He said Zimbabwe’s culture has tangible and intangible elements that complete the fabric of humanity with his song, Tree planting meant to encourage youngsters to adopt a culture of tree planting to mitigate climate change. “The song Tree planting is teaching values of responding to a changing climate by planting trees. When children enjoy doing such good deeds, our environment will be preserved for generations to come.” The album which was launched online due to Covid-19 restrictions on gatherings is being received well by local audiences, particularly children. <img class="alignnone wp-image-549800 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/uik.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/uik.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/uik-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chihora has carved a niche for himself in the music industry, earning prominence in music adjudication.
