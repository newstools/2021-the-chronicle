This is what he was born for, lived for and died for. “As Prophet TB Joshua says, “The greatest way to use life is to spend it on something that will outlive it,” the ministry shared on Facebook. TB Joshua was a fiery preacher who performed “miracles” before local and global television audiences. His expansive church auditorium in the Ikotun area of Lagos is a beehive and religious tourism resort for thousands of miracle seekers and worshipers from across the world. TB Joshua’s Emmanuel TV, which often displays jaw dropping miracles before fawning audiences, is also widely watched and followed across the world. A controversial character, TB Joshua often fell out with the state and some of his peers in ministry who questioned the source of his powers and miracles. pulse.ng
