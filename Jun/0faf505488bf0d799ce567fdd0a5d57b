The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HALL of fame inductee Andy Flower handed Blessing Muzarabani his first cap in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) as his Multan Sultans outfit cruised to an eight-wicket win over Peshawar Zalmi. Muzarabani hauled one wicket and conceded 37 runs at an economy rate of 9.2 in his allotted four overs on debut. He claimed the crucial wicket of hard hitter David Miller, whose strike rate was at 157.14 and looked set to make a big score. Mohammad Rizwan was the star of the show, however, for the Sultans as his knock of 82 from 56 balls made the chase for 167 easier. The victory bolstered Multan’s chances of finishing in the top four, and they are now tied with fourth-placed Karachi on six points. Peshawar remained third with eight points on the six-team table. Flower, who was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame on Sunday and is the Multan Sultans coach was delighted with Muzarabani’s performance. “It gives me great pleasure to have a fellow Zimbabwean in the squad, but also initially to watch your young career. It’s nice you have had a good start against Pakistan, good luck today,” said Flower. Muzarabani did not make the cut in the original PSL draft earlier this year, but his impressive performances in the recent tour of Zimbabwe by Pakistan caught the interest of the PSL club. – @innocentskizoe
