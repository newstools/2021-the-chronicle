The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HISTORY beckons for Zimbabwe fast bowler Blessing Muzarabani and his coach Andy Flower when their Multan Sultans outfit faces Peshawar Zalmi in the Pakistan Premier League final on Thursday night. The Sultans are appearing in the PSL final for the first time, while Peshawar Zalmi were winners in 2017 and runners up in 2019. In nine meetings between the two teams since the Sultans started playing in the PSL in 2017, Flower’s men have won five of those matches, while Peshawar Zalmi have taken four of the contests. Muzarabani has been one of the best performers for Sultans, taking eight wickets so far. Muzarabani only got into the Sultans’ side to take the place of Obed McCoy.
