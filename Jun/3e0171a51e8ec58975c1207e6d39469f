A MAGNETIC resonance imaging (MRI) scan has been recommended to determine the extent of Highlanders’ attacking central midfielder Divine Mhindirira’s knee injury. Mhindirira picked up a knee injury a fortnight ago during Highlanders’ last Chibuku Super Cup match against Bulawayo City which Bosso won 1-0 courtesy of a penalty converted by goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda. Mhindirira limped off in that encounter. According to Highlanders’ coach Mandla Mpofu, the midfielder, who has been holding fort in the absence of yet to be registered Joel Ngodzo, has been given about four weeks to recover. “Divine has been out for two weeks without doing any form of exercise because of the knee injury. While other players have been given programmes to follow, Divine still needs about two weeks to fully recover. However, that period might increase depending on results from the MRI scan. Our medical team wants to be cocksure of the extent of the injury,” Mpofu said. Since football has been suspended due to a spike in Covid-19 cases, Mhindirira could recover before action resumes. The relief for Highlanders is that Premier Soccer League’s partners Fidelity Life Insurance will bear the costs of Mhindirira’s tests and treatment. In 2019, The PSL entered into a three-year sponsorship deal with Fidelity Life Assurance to cater for the medical welfare of players and technical officials injured on club duty. Under the deal, worth about $1 million per season, players no longer have to worry about medical bills, while those that suffer career-ending injuries are set to get a once-off lump sum of $15 000. The cover, however, applies to injuries that occur during official PSL duties. Fidelity Life also availed life assurance and a funeral benefit plan for the players and officials of all 18 teams. — @ZililoR
