The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Business Correspondent THE Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) has called on the Government to clarify the timeline of the new Covid-19 business operating regulations to assist the industry in drafting plans on how to run their businesses. Vice President and Health and Child Care Minister Constantino Chiwenga over the weekend announced the new lockdown regulations which came into effect on Monday. The regulations follow last week’s 596 new cases and 26 deaths. “We applaud the Government for embarking on targeted lockdowns instead of wholesale lockdowns which have been used in the past. This will also give breathing space for businesses. “However, CZR requests the Government to put timelines on when the measures would end for planning purposes, like it has done in the past despite that there were extensions,” said the CZR president Mr Denford Mutashu in a statement. He said CZR welcomes the lockdown as the Government moves swiftly to protect lives of the society from the deadly pandemic. “The new measures are necessary in light of the rising new cases. President Emmerson Mnangagwa is on record saying it is better to save people as the economy would be resuscitated later. “As CZR, we embrace the measures and pledge that we will limit the number of clients in our shops as per the directive,” said Mr Mutashu. “Notwithstanding this, CZR urges the public and business community to do more in fighting Covid-19 as our behaviours determine actions government apply in order to safeguard the health of the nation. We are in this together,” he said. -@mthabisi_mthire
