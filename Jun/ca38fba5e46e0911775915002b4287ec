The Chronicle Bars, taverns and casinos in Zambia have been closed as the government enforces new measures to prevent further spread of coronavirus. The health ministry had last week said that starting Monday, these entertainment spots would only open during weekends. Mathew Ngulube, permanent secretary in the ministry of local government, said on Monday that the authorities had reviewed that directive and noted non-compliance hence closing all bars and casinos. The closure will take effect for 14 days but during that time, the stores will be allowed to sell alcohol on take-away basis. Schools were closed last week for 21 days to allow administrations to put in place preventive measures. The country is in the third Covid-19 wave and has recorded 149,661 virus cases so far. â€” BBC news
