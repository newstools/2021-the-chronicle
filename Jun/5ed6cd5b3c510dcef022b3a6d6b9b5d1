THE Environmental Management Agency (EMA) has adopted innovative ways among them the extensive use of digital platforms to achieve its minimum target reduction of 25 percent of land lost to veld fires this year. The agency’s manager for environment and education Ms Amkela Sidange yesterday said work had started, to streamline most awareness programmes to fit into the Covid-19 pandemic prevention protocols. She said the agency was rolling out an extensive community outreach programme dubbed the ‘Accelerated community fire awareness programme’. Ms Sidange said EMA had started raising awareness in hot spots around Mashonaland and Manicaland provinces. The veld fire season officially starts on July 31 and ends around October. “We have adopted a variety of approaches and strategies to raise public awareness and capacity on veld fire management,” said Ms Sidange. “Some of the strategies include the use of digital platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram; including use of the website to disseminate information on veld fire prevention. In addition, we are also carrying out community meetings, training and demos, talk shows and roadshows, among many others. “As we approach the veld fire season, we are calling on farmers, landowners, and tenants and farming communities to urgently put in place relevant and adequate measures to prevent veld fires.” She said the normal fire preparations have been hampered by the novel Covid-19 pandemic, but innovative ways have been employed to ensure improved fire management strategies are being implemented. Ms Sidange said all efforts were in line with the 2021 veld fires season theme ‘Veld fires and food security-Protect the harvest’. She said the agency had done mass production and distribution of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) Material ranging from posters, brochures, flyers, stickers and fire assessment reports.-@tupeyo
