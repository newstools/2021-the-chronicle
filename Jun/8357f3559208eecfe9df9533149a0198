The detectives arrested Ncube who upon interrogation led them to his accomplice. Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube yesterday said the duo’s arrest is part of the police’s ramped up efforts to arrest criminals terrorising the country committing armed robbery and burglary cases. Their arrest follows Police Commissioner General Godwin Matanga’s instruction to provincial commanders to deploy police special units to armed robbery hotbeds in a bid to eradicate crime. “We have arrested two suspected armed robbers linked to a robbery which occurred in Maphisa on June 14. The suspects, both aged 28 from Gwanda are said to have raided Nanet Mine in Maphisa where they shot one a man on the thigh and got away with US$1400. Their victim is hospitalised at UBH. This is one of the many armed robberies that are occurring in our country. Therefore, the CID detectives have cleared one of the cases,” said Insp Ncube. He said when police interrogated the suspects about the source of the gun, they revealed that it was smuggled from South Africa. “They claimed they bought the firearm from outside Zimbabwe for R3000. They have been charged with armed robbery and attempted murder. The accused person will appear in court soon,” he said. -@nqotshili
