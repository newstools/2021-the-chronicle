Traditional dance group Bolamba Culture Birds has been affected by South Africa’s new lockdown measures which came into effect yesterday. The 16-member group has five of its members based in South Africa and has been performing in the neighbouring country for a long time. Speaking from Johannesburg, Bolamba Culture Birds director Mthabisi Dube said they are working tirelessly to spread their wings regionally. He however, said the enforcement of the latest lockdown measures in South Africa had affected them as they have been forced to suspend staging shows. “We’ve been performing here for the past weeks but following the enforcement of the Level Four lockdown, we have suspended shows for the next two weeks,” Dube said. He said the group will during the two weeks prepare for the première of one of its productions at the Cape Town Baxter Theatre. Dube said plans were also underway to première their Highway to Africa musical production in Cape Town in September. He said Highway to Africa is a musical production that showcases the lifestyle of an African. September is promising to be a busy month for the group as they are also hoping to release their third album. The album was supposed to be released in April this year but was delayed by the Covid-19 disruptions. “We’re busy recording our third album here in South Africa and we want to launch the CD here and back home in September. – @mthabisi_mthire.
