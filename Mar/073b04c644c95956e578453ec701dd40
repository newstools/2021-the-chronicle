We want to become one of the most reliable literary publishing brands that also offer quality literary solutions and familiarise ourselves with budding and veteran artistes,” said King KG. “Our major point of interest or priority lies in the production and publication of both academic and non-academic content in traditional African languages that may include minority languages like Tjikalanga, Tonga and Venda.” The young artiste said the establishment of this publishing company came after years of contemplation and months of strategic planning adding that he is privileged to have gotten a business partner, Agnieszka Maria, a Polish friend whose involvement has made the dream a reality. – @mthabisi_mthire
