Today marks exactly a year since the arts sector was closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown. It has been tough as most artistes have been failing to make ends meet as most relied on their arts careers. During the week, artistes in Harare teamed up and met the Deputy Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Tino Machakaire where they pleaded with Government to open up the arts sector. They also quizzed why they cannot be allowed to operate like their counterparts in South Africa, Nigeria and Ghana who have been permitted to host shows under Covid-19 regulations. They went on to highlight that the Covid-19 relief fund which they were given last year was not enough as many of them did not receive anything. Although artistes were permitted to stage virtual shows last year, not much can be realised from such shows compared to the paying fans at live shows. Even the numbers during these free live virtual shows have not been impressive in some instances, showing how ineffective the shows have been. Late last year, pay-per-view virtual shows were introduced in a way to try and cushion artistes but they sadly did not get traction as there was a small uptake. The artistes are frustrated hence are appealing to Government to allow them to resume live shows under strict Covid-19 health protocols as is happening in other countries. Veteran arts practitioner, Cont Mhlanga suggested that the arts ministry should identify at least two venues in each province where musicians can perform for live crowds under strict Covid-19 regulations. “The ministry needs to provide a permanent solution in terms of where these musicians can perform. They need to designate venues, a minimum of two per province, for use by artistes that will be compliant in terms of Covid-19 regulations. “Then musicians can promote their shows there and also kick-start tours,” said Mhlanga. Iyasa director Nkululeko Dube said there is need to gradually reopen the arts sector as Covid-19 is not going away anytime soon. <img class="wp-image-433154 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Nkululeko-Dube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="381" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Nkululeko-Dube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Nkululeko-Dube-360x202.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nkululeko Dube “We need to educate our artistes and audiences on how to adapt to the ‘new normal’ so that they can be safe at events. Shows and events can be controlled. Numbers can be limited. Event organisers can be managed to comply with safety protocols,” Dube said. Concurring with Mhlanga’s sentiments, Dube said: “We can gradually open the sector starting with allowing artistes to rehearse and do small events with limited audiences. Certain bigger venues can be approved, equipped and monitored for special events. “It’s everyone’s responsibility and at the same time, the arts are a source of living for many. Shutting down the sector cannot be the only solution.” Theatre guru, Raisedon Baya said theatre and literary arts should be allowed to operate as they generally do not attract hordes of people. “Theatre is not a crowded art, especially in this country. Rarely do you get crowds of hundreds. The play has to be extremely good and popular for that. So, the sector should be allowed to open and observe the WHO Covid-19 protocols. “In the venue, people can sit two chairs apart and we’ll see how this works. The challenge now is we have lumped all arts into one group,” said Baya. <img class="wp-image-465151 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Raisedon-Baya.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Raisedon-Baya.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Raisedon-Baya-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Raisedon Baya Musician Jeys Marabini said Government should allow artistes to operate while observing the required health protocols. “We ask Government to trust us. We will comply with the required health protocols once we are allowed to stage shows. If they say only 100 or 500 people per venue, that is that. “There are big venues where we can hold shows and be able to sanitise people and enforce wearing of masks and social distancing. We can’t just sit and do nothing about this situation because at the end of the day art will become extinct,” said Jeys. <img class="wp-image-535969 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Jeys-Marabini.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Jeys-Marabini.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Jeys-Marabini-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Jeys Marabini During the meeting with Deputy Minister Machakaire on Tuesday, sungura maestro, Alick Macheso said things were hard for artistes as they are struggling to make ends meet. “We’ve been reduced to beggars so there’s a need for Government to intervene as we’ve seen other sectors being given the green light to open. We’re also asking for the partial reopening of our industry for us to survive. “Also, if we can get housing stands and loans to build houses,” Macheso said. Dancehall singer, Seh Calaz said Government needs to chip in urgently as most youthful musicians are abusing drugs because of depression that is being caused by inactivity.
