COMEDIAN Nceku has relocated from South Africa to Cyprus as he seeks to grow his brand. The talented comedian-cum-musician left Bulawayo for South Africa five years ago in search of greener pastures. After accomplishing his mission there, his focus is now on penetrating the global scene. Nceku (real name Thubelihle Sibanda) through his Sapphire Rock management confirmed the move that happened at the beginning of the year. Sapphire Rock managing director, Antonette Mabhena said the move marks the beginning of big things in the artiste’s career. “Nceku has relocated to Cyprus. How the move came about is one aspect we’re not yet ready to share, but in good time, all will be out in the open. “All we can say for now is that vision 2021 is to grow the Nceku brand internationally and work on improving the quality of our productions,” said Mabhena. Mabhena added that Nceku will ensure that he does not lose relevance locally due to his move. “This year is more about learning the creation and development of the concepts of the work that Nceku does. With him having taken a step back in terms of being an MC to focus on his online presence, comedy work and the quality thereof, we’re excited about what the rest of the year has in store as our plans start to unfold. “We, however, hope that we keep the unending support of his fans as this is just but the beginning of something greater.” Nceku burst into the comedy scene in 2016 with his hilarious skits which he posted on various social media platforms. A year later, to prove his versatility, he released a maskandi Christian song titled Vele Ang’kuzwa. Through his comedy and music, Nceku received many invites to MC and perform at several events on the continent and abroad. What made him stand out was that his jokes were clean as he performed what he termed Christian Comedy. – @mthabisi_mthire
