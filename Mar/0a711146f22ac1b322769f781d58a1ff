The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter FORMER Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) acting chief executive officer Moses Julius Juma is on the run after losing a High Court appeal against his conviction for abuse of office. Juma was first arrested in 2016 for abuse office but was released after former Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko stormed Avondale Police Station and demanded his release. He was rearrested in 2018 and sentenced to 30 months in prison and was expected to serve two years in jail with six months being suspended for good behaviour. Juma was arrested for handpicking a tax consultancy company for a contract worth US$500 000 without going to tender. Juma approached the High Court appealing against his conviction and was granted $5 000 bail. However, the apex court upheld his sentence.
