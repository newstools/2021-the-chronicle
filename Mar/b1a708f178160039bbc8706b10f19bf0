A FAMILY of nine whose house was destroyed by fire in January has moved back into the property after residents renovated it. This has showcased immense community solidarity where residents were “their brother’s keeper.” Mr Masauso Sakala, a Victoria Falls safari operator said he almost gave up on life when his seven-roomed house was gutted by fire in Mkhosana in January but residents quickly formed a “Help Sakala Fundraising Committee” comprising Victoria Falls mayor Councillor Somveli Dlamini,Hwange West MP Mr Godfrey Dube, and Victoria Falls Ward 11 Clr Edmore Zhou in whose ward the house is located, and mostly neighbours. The committee secured a temporary house for the family and took care of its upkeep as it started mobilising resources to rebuild the house. Tragedy befell the family when two solar batteries burst and started a fire that burnt everything in the seven-roomed house. Two minor girls who were in the house escaped unhurt and neighbours helped alert the fire brigade which put out the fire, although it was too late as all household property was reduced to ashes. The corrugated iron roofing sheets were badly damaged while roof trusses were reduced to charcoal and some of the walls were condemned by the Victoria Falls City buildings inspector and had to be demolished. All has been replaced and workmen were on Sunday fitting windows and finalising other minor finishing touches. The family comprise Mr Sakala (49) who owns Ultimate Fishing Safaris, his wife Mrs Sitshengisiwe Sakala (46), their three daughters and other dependants all aged between three and 24. The committee chaired by neighbour Mr Cosmas Moyo managed to mobilise US$6 532, $10 100, R220 and 200 Pula cash. Other well wishers donated building material, food, clothes and other items. The committee set a deadline of February 28 to complete the house and handed it to the family on Sunday, marking its return to the house. <img class="wp-image-534277 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Sakala2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Sakala2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Sakala2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Victoria Falls residents volunteered to provide labour to repair the Sakalas’ house Mr Moyo said the incident is a humanitarian lesson. “As neighbours we didn’t know what to do after tragedy struck. We are touched by this great job, the benevolence of residents and well wishers. We want to encourage the community to come together to help each other in times of need. We have learnt that umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu from this incident,” he said. Handing over the keys for the house to Mr and Mrs Sakala, Cllr Dlamini said Victoria Falls had exhibited a high degree of ubuntu. “I am delighted to be leading a community that is so united. This is examplary because some local authorities cannot do what you as residents have done. “As council we will sit and make sure we tighten loopholes around disaster management because we have fire hydrants here which should have been used,” he said. An elated Mr Sakala said he was grateful to the help he received from the community. “I don’t even know how to thank the community. When this happened we lost everything and were left with the clothes we were wearing hence we didn’t know where to start. You gave us clothes, shelter, food and money and today we are coming back to a completed house. I am short of words,” he said. The Victoria Falls community is reciprocating the spirit of ubuntu that Mr Sakala and his family always exhibit, according to residents.— @ncubeleon
