ZAMBIAN forward Gamphani Lungu believes they have enough quality in their squad to notch up two victories against Algeria and Zimbabwe in this week’s Afcon final qualifiers. Former African champions Zambia play against Algeria on Thursday before they travel to Zimbabwe for a date with the Warriors four days later. Algeria are already through to the finals, but the remaining spot is still up for grabs, with Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana all still in contention. Zimbabwe sit second in the group with five points, a point ahead of Botswana, while Zambia are bottom of the table with three points. Lungu, who turns out for South African side SuperSport United, fancies his side’s chances against both Algeria and Zimbabwe. “Our team has all the quality you can ask for in every department. We just need to keep on working hard and trusting each other. Trust each other, fight for each other, fight for the country; that’s what we need to do so, we are playing two games, that is Algeria, which is our starting point. Let’s not think of Zimbabwe now, let’s just think of Algeria right now, let’s take one game at a time,” said Lungu ahead of the two crucial encounters. “Honestly for me, I feel like I am going to give my best for the nation. I am going to fight, I’m going to run my lungs out on the field for the country and it’s up to the coaches because the coaches are the ones that get to pick the team. Whoever is picked on that day that’s the best XI for the day; it’s not about who’s better than the rest, but it’s about who can carry the team on that day,” he added. – @innocentskizoe
