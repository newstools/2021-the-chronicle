The Chronicle Astute businesswoman and reality show star Shauwn Mkhize, is the latest star to join SABC 1’s prime time soapie Uzalo. The cat was finally let out of the bag by the show through an Instagram post on its Instagram account teasing her highly anticipated debut soon. Mamkhize is joining a star-studded cast of the show including the likes of Dawn Thandeka King, Nompilo Maphumulo and Thuthuka Mthembu. It comes as a surprise to many that Mkhize has now decided to venture into acting as she rose to superstardom with her reality show Kwa maMkhize which features her family. Although she has never acted before and this will be her first acting stint on a national platform, it seems she is spreading her wings in the industry by testing the waters in the world of acting. By the look of things, it seems her debut will have millions of viewers on the edge of their collective seats. Shauwn’s maturity and humble demeanour continues to steal the hearts of many. Uzalo has been shaking things up with new characters joining the show and others exiting. It was recently reported that its former actors including Khaya Dladla, TK Dlamini, Nay Maps as well as Nokuthula Mabika will be making their big return this year. “I’m not sure when I’m going to appear on TV, but we have agreed to come back to Uzalo. I’m preparing to be on set soon,” Khaya told Daily Sun. Bringing these much-loved characters and Mamkhize on board could possibly see an increase in viewership which will be great news for the show. Uzalo’s storyline has been the talk of the town lately with many people boycotting to watch the show’s “boring storyline.” Recently SABC 1 announced a three-year agreement with the famed Stained Glass production. It was the first time that such a long-term arrangement was put in place and it represents an unequivocal vote of confidence the channel places in Mzansi’s best-performing soapie by far. – Zalebs.
