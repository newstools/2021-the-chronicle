The Chronicle The PSL’s first-ever Footballer of the Season Wilfred “Silver Fox’’ Mugeyi says it will be difficult for Mamelodi Sundowns striker Peter Shalulile to be crowned the best player this season. Mugeyi was the first player to be crowned the Footballer of the Season in the PSL era as he walked away with both awards in the 1996/97 campaign when he scored 22 league goals for Bush Bucks. Despite scoring in almost every game for log leaders Sundowns, Shalulile sits on eight league goals for the campaign, five goals behind Supersport United’s danger man Bradley Grobler. Mugeyi believes not scoring enough will hinder the Namibian’s chances of being crowned the PSL best player as strikers are always judged on goals. “Ya mostly it’s very rare to win without being a top goalscorer,’’ Mugeyi tells KickOff.com. “But I give him a chance as well because I think he’s doing very well. He’s one of the hottest players at the moment. But where it’s tricky now it’s where you get the likes of Grobler being top goalscorers, and they are doing well as well. So in that case the likes of Grobler will take the Player of the Year, because he is doing two things, being a top goalscorer and playing well as well. ‘‘Now we have got Shalulile who is playing well but not scoring enough goals. So whom do you take? That’s the trick because you cannot choose him over Grobler who is doing well as well in the goalscoring department. So for him to win it, he needs to score goals.” Mugeyi also explained the reason Shalulile has been unable to reach 10 goals so far despite finding the net on a regular basis. “The problem for him you know, the likes of Grobler they are scoring two goals, three goals . . . he scores one. So he needs to work on his goalscoring. Yes he’s scoring goals but he’s not doing much.’’ — KickOff
