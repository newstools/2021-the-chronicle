UNICEF has partnered Red Cross and rehabilitated five boreholes in Gwanda town, Matabeleland South province. The rehabilitation is set to ease water shortages which have over time affected residents. The rehabilitated boreholes are located at the Gwanda Municipality central business district park, Red Cross offices in Jahunda, Spitzkop North near Njanji area, Ultra High suburb and one behind Gwanda Adventist Primary School (Gaps). All the borehole facilities provide free clean water access to the surrounding communities. The move is also set to help prevent an outbreak of diseases such as cholera and typhoid. In an interview, Ward 2 councillor Nappy Moyo said the boreholes will benefit the community of Gwanda. “We are grateful to the donor UNICEF and the implementing partner Red Cross for such a great initiative. “The rehabilitation of boreholes will help us as a community taking note that in Gwanda we are usually faced with pipe bursts,” said Clr Moyo. She said the boreholes will be a panacea to water shortages in Gwanda. “When pipe bursts occur in the area (CBD). Usually they number up to three and this affects the easy flow of water and access to the end user, the residents. The boreholes will help the community and alleviate the water shortages and keep people safe,” said Clr Moyo.-@mthabisi_mthire
