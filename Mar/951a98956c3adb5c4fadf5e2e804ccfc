THREE months after leaving top English Premiership side Worcester Warriors, Zimbabwe Sables prop Farai Mudariki has found a new home in France. The 26-year-old, whose stay at Warriors was punctuated by injuries, joined French Pro2 League side USON Nevers.
Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) broke the news of Mudariki’s move to France on its social media platforms. “The Zimbabwe Rugby Union would like to congratulate the Zimbabwe Sables strongman Farai Mudariki on signing for USON Nevers in the French Pro2 League. The Zimbabwean international (1.85 m, 119kg) already knows French rugby since he went through the Castres Olympique training centre for two years before playing in Tarbes, in Federal 1 (2017-2018) and Worcester in the UK,” wrote ZRU. Mudariki arrived at Sixways in the summer of 2018 from French club Tarbes on the recommendation of former Warriors’ lock James Percival. Mudariki had previously spent two years in the academy roster of Top 14 club Castres. He made his debut in the Premiership Rugby Cup victory over Sale Sharks in October 2019 and scored his first try for Warriors in the victory over Leicester Tigers in the same competition 11 months later. But that proved to be Mudariki’s third and final appearance for Warriors as an ankle injury sustained in training brought an early end to his season. After the injury problems, Mudariki was eager to break into the Warriors’ first team this season after being rewarded with a new contract by the Premiership club in January last year. Suspension of English topflight fixtures in March last year owing to Covid-19 affected Mudariki’s comeback plans resulting in the Zimbabwean national team player missing out on a contract renewal.
