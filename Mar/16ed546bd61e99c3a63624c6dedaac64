Highlanders could face court action from club member Cornelius Ngwazane for not heeding his seven-day ultimatum for the board to reverse its decision to extend the term of three executive committee members. Ngwazane wrote to Highlanders president Ndumiso Gumede on February 25, giving the Bulawayo giants one week to reverse the board’s decision or face court action. He described the board’s decision as illegal, contending that it does not have powers to extend the term of office of the three executive committee members. The seven-day period expired Monday and Ngwazane said he had response from Bosso. “As I speak to you this (Tuesday) morning, I do not have any communication from the club noting that the seven days expired yesterday on Monday. I am now left with no choice but to seek the help of the courts. It is sad that some people tend to forget that authority in an institution like ours lies in trust from members. However, when they get to positions they suddenly think they are an authority unto themselves. Maybe they communicated with my lawyers, but like I am saying by end of business yesterday (Monday) I had not heard anything,” said Ngwazane. Contacted for comment, Gumede was adamant that he had not received any correspondence on the matter. “I have not received any correspondence from one Conelious Ngwazane,” said Gumede. Highlanders lawyer Zibusiso Charles Ncube also expressed ignorance about the letter. “The letter was not brought to my attention,” said Ncube.
