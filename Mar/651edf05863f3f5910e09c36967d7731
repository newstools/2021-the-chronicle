Afro-pop and house musician Mzoe 7, who is part of the headline acts at the National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) Legends @40 showcase, taking place this Saturday has promised a stellar performance. He said he is hard at work rehearsing as he wants to increase his popularity in the cut-throat industry through such platforms. The inaugural #NAMA legends@40 Awards will be held virtually under the theme: “Our Legacy, Our Pride.” Forty legends will be honoured in celebration of the country’s 40 years of independence. Commenting on the forthcoming event, Mzoe 7 said: “I’m honoured to be performing at the Namas as it’ll be my first time. It’s a dream come true to be on the same poster with the legendary Busi Ncube, an icon I’ve always admired growing up. “She inspired our parents, brothers and sisters so to perform alongside her is more than a blessing. I’m seriously rehearsing for this performance as I want it to stand out.” — @mthabisi_mthire
