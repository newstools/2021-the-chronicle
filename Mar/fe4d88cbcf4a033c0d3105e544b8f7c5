ZIFA Central region has launched an interactive website in its quest to facilitate communication with its affiliates and the public. Violet Jubane, the region’s marketing, development and communications officer, said they’ll be able to provide up to date information through their website. Jubane, a holder of a high-level Fifa Master Badge, said they will also be able to market their leagues to the rest of the world. “We are very excited to announce the launch of our newly designed website. We endeavour to provide our client partners with the most accurate, up-to-date information and share our experiences with the rest of the world. Our goal with this new website is to provide our visitors an easier way to learn about the Central Region Soccer League services,” said Jubane. She said social media platforms links have also been added to make the site interactive. “Among the new features the site contains are integrated social media buttons for Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to foster improved communication with the stakeholders. We will be constantly updating our content with helpful information, cutting edge thought announcements and success stories in the blog and news section,” Jubane said. — @ZililoR
