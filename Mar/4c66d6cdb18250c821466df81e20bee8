The Chronicle Langalakhe Mabena South Africa-based Afro Pop and dance musician, La Dee (real name Duduzile Ndlovu) whose career is flourishing in the neighbouring country is preparing to release an Amapiano love single titled Happiness this Sunday. The single which was produced by fast-rising producers Conga Brothers under BHK Productions will be released on all music sites. La Dee, a versatile vocalist who can also flex with Mbaqanga and gospel genres said the song was influenced by different obstacles that women face in their everyday lives. She said the song which she had hoped to release on Monday, International Women’s Day, promotes love, happiness and togetherness. <img class="wp-image-535437 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/lADE.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/lADE.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/lADE-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> La Dee “Happiness is a love song. It talks about the journey a lady takes until she finds love and happiness. The song was inspired by life experiences especially of women as they face a lot of struggles, but yet they are pillars for all households. “I had planned to release the song on International Women’s Day because the song inspires women to find happiness in life. However, my advisers suggested that it be released on 14 March instead.” La Dee who last year dropped a banger titled Isoka Lami revealed that Happiness will be part of her EP which will be released before the year ends. The EP is said to feature local artistes, among them Mzoe 7 and a number of artistes from Southern Africa. “Apart from Happiness, I’m working on an EP which will feature different creatives from Southern Africa because I believe music is universal. For us artistes to grow our fan base, it has to be through collaborations,” she said. Apart from music, La Dee is an entrepreneur who has interest in Beauty Therapy. Recently, she started working for Swaziland’s Hala Radio Station, a job she said gives her joy and fulfills her happiness. – @langamabena
