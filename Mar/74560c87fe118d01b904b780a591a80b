HORACE Ndubiwa has stepped down as Bulawayo City FC secretary citing work pressure although sources claim he quit due to irreconcilable differences with executive chairman Jerry Sibanda. Ndubiwa confirmed to Chronicle Sport that he had stepped down but declined to shed light on his reasons, referring all questions to Sibanda. “I can confirm that I have stepped down ( as club secretary). Anything else please talk to the chairman,” said Ndubiwa, who previously held the same position at City rivals Highlanders. Sibanda declined to comment on reports of his alleged differences with Ndubiwa. An insider told Chronicle Sport that Ndubiwa quit after complaining that the club was a one-man band and only Sibanda’s views and opinions always carried the day. “He felt his presence was not needed since his views and those of other executive committee members were always quashed by Sibanda,” said the insider. However, another insider said it wasn’t true that Ndubiwa resigned because of differences with Sibanda. “How do we talk about differences four years down the line? Ndubiwa has been part of the team for those years and remember these are voluntary posts; no one is voted into office like kwendala (Bosso) so, talking of differences is just trying to cause unnecessary tension between Jerry and Horace. The two are close buddies,” he said. Sibanda has led Amakhosi since they were promoted to the Premier Soccer League and has been applauded for accommodating former players in the club’s teams. A number of corporate bodies have also partnered with City due to the club’s clear governance structures.
