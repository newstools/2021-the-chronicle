TOMASIK Tennis Academy administrator Khumbulani Tembo has hailed the move by the Sports and Recreation Commission to give tennis the nod to resume and said they were now working on logistics to start training soon. “We are still working on permission to start all our day-to-day operations. We had 15 players in our ranks before the Covid-19 pandemic caused everything to stop last year. We are hoping to retain all the players when we start training. Our coach Mike Mlambo is ready to commence all practice sessions and the players have also shown interest to return to the court,” said Tembo. The academy is based at Emakhandeni Tennis Club and focuses on the development of young talent from the suburb and surrounding areas. It was founded by Switzerland-based former Zimbabwe Davis Cup player Fadzai Madzimbamuto. It caters for players from the age of six, with the aim of nurturing them into professionals. Since its inception, the academy has held a number of tournaments and courses that are critical to the development of the game in Bulawayo. It has so far produced the likes of Felix Tazvivinga and Martin Nyoni, who have represented Zimbabwe at various regional International Tennis Federation competitions. Tennis had been given permission to resume last year on condition that each facility hires an enforcement officer to enforce adherence to the health and safety guidelines. Under last year’s guidelines, only players registered with Tennis Zimbabwe and with an official clearance letter were allowed to resume activities. Only the coach could provide and pick up all practice balls, and could also provide equipment like baskets, cones and ladders, which had to be sanitised after every session. Players’ bags were not allowed on the tennis court. — @innocentskizoe.
