LEGISLATOR and former Zifa vice-president Omega Sibanda has warned of future sport contractual disputes, especially in football, which continues to be frozen by the Covid-19 pandemic, and urged Government to avail special grants to national sports associations to help avoid the possible disputes. Sibanda made this warning during a parliamentary question and answer session last week in which he asked the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation why it had taken long to allow sporting activities to resume. “Can you clarify Hon Minister, why is it that you have taken so long to act on these sporting disciplines in view of the fact that our teams are participating internationally and we are failing to perform? Our neighbours like South Africa and Zambia, for example, are playing football, but we are not doing anything, we are not seeing anything. “There are what are called player contracts; teams are losing, including other sports also. Those contractual obligations, how are the teams going to fulfil them when players are not playing? Are you going to assist in terms of Government funding or grants?” asked Sibanda, the Vungu MP. In his response, Deputy Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Tino Machakaire said the country faced challenges after it was hit by Covid-19, but was hoping the ministry will come up with an adjusted position. “We are going to sit down and have a position which will make sure that all games and players, like he said, are going to be looked after and try to adjust the challenges that we had,” said Deputy Minister Machakaire. Last week the Government allowed 24 sport codes deemed low risk to resume activities under strict Covid-19 health protocols and guidelines.
