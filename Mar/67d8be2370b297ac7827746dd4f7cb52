THE Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) has started preparations to host the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) inter-provincial championships at the end of this month. The association has tentatively set March 27 as the date for the meet to be staged at White City Stadium. “We have begun preparations for the meet. This will be our first event of the year. Initially this event was meant to be held on March 20 according to our calendar. So, we are not far off the dates we had planned at the beginning of the year. “We will continue to follow the calendar as we seek to hold a number of events. We’re excited that our activities have resumed. The athletes have been longing to compete and we will work to ensure that we have a strong field of highly competitive participants,” said Bab chairperson Watson Madanyika. In November last year, Bab played host to a similar Naaz event. The competition was conducted under strict Covid-19 protocols, with only five track events; 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m and 5 000m being staged on the day after relays and field competitions were scrapped. Each of the country’s 10 provinces were restricted to fielding just two athletes in the men’s and women’s categories.
Only registered athletes were allowed into the venue that had also been disinfected. The event also saw the electronic timer at White City Stadium which was repaired in March last year being put to use for the first time, authenticating athletes’ times compared to previous years when they were timed manually. – @innocentskizoe
