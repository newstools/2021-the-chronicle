THE second edition of the Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF2021) has been rescheduled to December to allow for a wider roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccines across the continent. IATF, which is a biennial event is organised by AfreximBank in collaboration with the African Union (AU). In a statement, AfreximBank said the second edition of IATF2021 was inititially scheduled from the 6th to the 12th of September but will now run from December 8 to 14 in Kigali, Rwanda. “IATF is now set to take place from 8 to 14 December 2021. AfreximBank, AU and the Government of Rwanda have decided to shift the date of the continental trade fair, which was previously scheduled to hold from 6 to 12 September 2021, to allow for a broader roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines across the continent and ensure that the event is held under the most optimal health conditions,” it said. It is hoped that the IATF2021 would be crucial in assisting and enabling businesses and corporates across Africa to share trade and market information and conclude business deals that are critical in supporting the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which began operating on 1 January this year. – @okazunga.
