The Coca-Cola Foundation has invested US$50 000 to help address Bulawayo’s water problems in a development that will see six solar-powered boreholes being sunk at as many sites in the city. Under the Coca-Cola Foundation’s Bulawayo City Water Project, which will be implemented by the Danchurch Aid, Emakhandeni, Old Pumula, Pumula South and Magwegwe North – are set to benefit. The ground breaking ceremony was held at Emakhandeni suburb yesterday. Coca -Cola Africa representative Mr Milidzani Ncube said the project seeks to help address the water problems that the city has been experiencing. “The project has received US$50 000 from the Coca-Cola Foundation and will make water available to over 25 000 residents of Bulawayo. The project will involve the drilling of six boreholes, installation of solar pumping mechanism and accessories for water kiosks and tanks which will greatly enhance the livelihoods of the people of Bulawayo,” said Mr Ncube He said the foundation is working with support from their bottling partners Delta and Schweppes Zimbabwe to address the water shortage that Bulawayo continues to experience. <img class="alignnone wp-image-534786 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/cola.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/cola.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/cola-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “It is an issue that is of great concern to us as the Coca-Cola system in Zimbabwe. On completion the project will improve access to safe drinking water, improve sanitation and hygiene; and reduce the risks of water-borne infectious diseases for Bulawayo communities. For many of us, Bulawayo has a special place in our memories and our hearts. We recognise their water needs and we want to be there for them in good and bad times,” he said. He said when the challenges of water in Bulawayo were brought to their attention, they approached the company`s philanthropic arm, the Coca-Cola Foundation who agreed to support the project. Mr Ncube also committed his company`s future in the country saying their connection with the Zimbabwean people has always been good. Bulawayo deputy mayor Councillor Mlandu Ncube hailed the Coca-Cola Foundation for the gesture which he said dovetails with the city`s mandate to provide safe and clean water to residents. “As a city we have recently undergone a prolonged water shedding but are slowly stabilising the system. The city is progressively working towards reducing water shedding and we hope that by mid-March, we will be able to provide water to residents daily. We have been able to replace equipment such as the flow serve pumps and conduct various repairs and upgrading to our water works,” said Cllr Ncube. He said partnerships are important in facilitating sustainable development as partners are able to put in their resources and minds together for the wellbeing of citizens. Cllr Ncube urged residents to safeguard the equipment by providing security. “As Bulawayo we value community ownership of these boreholes and we have water point committees that are set up at each water point that is established by council whether it is a borehole or water kiosk. “ I call upon residents to guard jealously these boreholes that are being drilled so that at the end of the day the city of Bulawayo is a good steward to any investment made by partners,” he said. Cllr Ncube said the city`s dams had a combined carrying capacity of 69,71 percent as of Wednesday. Last week President Mnangagwa commissioned the Gwayi-Shangani to Bulawayo pipeline which is part of the permanent solution to the Bulawayo water problems as well as the Epping forest project a short-term measure.-@themkhust
