According to the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz), the number of people using mobile phones was up 3.2 percent during the period to 13 191 708, pushing the country’s mobile penetration rate to 90.5 percent from 87.7 percent. “Mobile Internet and data traffic grew by 13.1 percent to record 16 834  terabytes in the fourth quarter of 2020 from 14 878 terabytes recorded in the third quarter of 2020,” the regulator said in a latest report for the period under review.
