The Chronicle Bloggers were awarded at the 2021 Zim Blog Awards with the winners list being released yesterday. Notable among the winners was Bulawayo-based Afro-tribal musician Stewie Le Savage through his blog accordingtostewielasavage and Ingudukazi Magazine. A blog (a shortened version of “weblog”) is an online journal or informational website displaying information in reverse chronological order, with the latest posts appearing first, at the top. It is a platform where a writer or a group of writers share their views on an individual subject. <img class="wp-image-537626 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/mimimi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/mimimi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/mimimi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ameera Mimi of Kicking it with Mimmie In a statement, award organisers said they received overwhelming entries showing the growth of the medium. “After 302 nominations, 6 681 votes and hours of checking and vetting, we have reached the climax of the 2021 Zim Blog Awards. Over the past three editions, we’ve learnt and grown and we were pleased to see that the quality in content creators has grown with us. “This time around, we have five recurring winners and 20 new winners from the previous editions. A positive sign for us symbolising the growth of our creative industry. It may also be a silver lining from the pandemic, as it allowed creatives time and opportunity to discover, reinvent, create and improve,” said the organisers. “The category that has experienced the most growth is the personal blog category. Growing by 15% this edition and 8% the previous edition, personal blogs are proving to be a great place for one to express their creativity. “Often, we see content creators use them to write about their personal experiences covering various topics from book reviews, mental health, fitness, food, relationships, politics, sports and social issues, but they really don’t niche down to a specific topic. Plenty of the personal blogs are a mixed bag of well-crafted content and this category continues to be the most competitive every year.” However, organisers noted that there are some categories that have not grown as much as some had no more than three viable nominations while some had no nominations at all. “Photography, health and fitness, travel, food and drink, spiritual and religion, automotive, education, family and parenting, hair and beauty, humanitarian, relationships and dating, are just some of the categories that received low numbers of nominations. There is a big opportunity for content creators to niche out of their personal blogs and dominate other categories,” noted organisers. “A pleasant feature for us this year was to see nominations for the corporate blog category. Signs that the local corporate world is investing more into content creation and the consumers are appreciating it enough to nominate their favourite corporate blogs.”  Below is a list of the Zim Blog Awards 2021 winners: BEST ARTS AND CULTURE Zimbo Son BEST BUSINESS AND FINANCE The Entrepreneurial Magazine BEST CREATIVE WRITING Tudzaa BEST ENTERTAINMENT 263 Culture BEST FASHION AND STYLE Thick’N’Stylish BEST PERSONAL BLOG Impilo Nje BEST SELF-DEVELOPMENT/MOTIVATIONAL Motimagz Magazine BEST WOMEN AND GIRLS iNgudukazi Magazine BEST TECH/DIGITAL/SCIENCE Techzim BEST SOCIAL ISSUES AND POLITICS Kubatana BEST AUTOMOTIVES Drivetorque BEST EDUCATION HeyAnci BEST FOOD AND DRINK Zimbo Kitchen BEST LIFESTYLE Kicking it with Mimi BEST MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION Mumhanzi Media BEST RELATIONSHIPS AND DATING Life and Things with Faithpanashe BEST SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGION Hallelujahmag.com BEST TEEN BLOGGER Highs and Lows BEST CORPORATE BLOG BPO Zimbabwe BEST HAIR AND BEAUTY Runako Connect BEST HUMANITARIAN According to Stewie Le Savage BEST TRAVEL AND TOURISM Tanaka Travels PODCAST OF THE YEAR Feeling Station VLOGGER OF THE YEAR Kumbirai neRutendo BLOGGER OF THE YEAR Zimbo Son
