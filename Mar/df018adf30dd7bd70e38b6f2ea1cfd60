WHILE many have become accustomed to the works of multi-award-winning videographers, Andy Cutta and Vusa Blaqs, there is another player, Rasquesity Keaitse who they need to be on the lookout for as he is slowly taking over the Matabeleland region. Through well-polished works that he has produced with his film company, Keaitse Films, more and more artistes from the region are seeking Rasquesity’s services as they seek to expand their careers by having quality visuals. His wonderful work can be seen on Mzoe 7’s Asambeni video, Master Zhoe’s Gwenyambira and Novuyo Seagirl’s recent Imbokodo visuals.
Yet he remains largely unknown. Born Qinisela Keaitse, 29 years ago, Rasquesity is a lover of all things art, something which saw him study for a Bachelor of Science Honours Degree in Film and Theatre Arts at Midlands State University nine years ago. <img class="wp-image-538777 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Rasquesity-Keaitse.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Rasquesity-Keaitse.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Rasquesity-Keaitse-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rasquesity Keaitse For those who learnt at this institution during those days, they would remember that quite a number of artistes emerged from there including musician Nox and hip hop crew, Team Bho. While at the institution, Rasquesity tried out his filming skills by producing visuals for Team Bho’s Hamuko song. To his pleasant surprise, the video clinched a Zimbabwe Hip Hop Music Award in 2014. Since then, he has not looked back and continued to be rewarded for his works. In 2017, he won the Best Outstanding TV production and 2020 Best Music Video. Reflecting on his journey, Rasquesity said his dedication and perseverance have seen him pull through. “I was inspired to do film because I was passionate about it and wanted to put the city on the map. Film defines who I am and I’ll never rest until I contribute to the development of the local film and TV industry. “I’m glad to say we now have notable productions like ACE that shows on Zambezi Magic, Golddiggers movie also showing on Zambezi Magic, Dlala Ngamla series on ZBC and Go Bantu UK,” he said. “Also, we’ve produced over 70 music videos and did the M-net@30 promotions under Reality Motion Pictures SA which was a great experience.” In the past, most artistes did not take videos seriously, but nowadays, they have realised the importance of visuals. Rasquesity said he is pleased that artistes in Matabeleland have embraced videos although most of them do not have the necessary budgets for them to compete with productions of folks from Harare or neighbouring South Africa. <img class="wp-image-538779 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Rasquesity-Keaitse-on-set-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Rasquesity-Keaitse-on-set.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Rasquesity-Keaitse-on-set-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rasquesity Keaitse on set But, this is not deterring Rasquesity from working with them on little or close to no budgets to deliver the best. “We do most of the videos for free for the artistes as we fund them through our company’s film and TV resources which is managed by Kudzai Chikomo (creative director). “Kudzai has played a huge role in the development and growth of local videos as he funds them and uses my services for delivery,” Rasquesity said. Although the Covid-19 pandemic has left the arts scene strained, Keaitse Films managed to work on television projects such as documentaries and the Bazukuru comedy series last year. “In 2021, we’re focusing on the ultimate development of the Bulawayo film and television space. Because of the effects of the pandemic on the arts scene, we’re looking at giving out promotions on music video production to local artistes so as to promote their growth,” he said. At his film company that operates in Nketa 7, Rasquesity said he does not have permanent workers as he relies on contract workers. — @mthabisi_mthire
