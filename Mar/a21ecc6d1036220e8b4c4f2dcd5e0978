Preparations for the inaugural National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) Legends@40 awards taking place this Saturday are at an advanced stage and musician Ammara Brown will be the host. The awards seek to honour and recognise living legendary creatives who have raised the country’s flag high over the past 40 years. The awards will run under the theme “Our Legacy, Our Pride”. The awards will be held virtually and performances will be from legendary Busi Ncube, Mzoe 7, Tammy Moyo, Sylent Nqo, ExQ, Anita Jackson, Nutty O, Tariro NeGitare, Jose Sax and Fadza Mutengi hit-maker Poptain. National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) communication and marketing manager, Rodney Ruwende said: “The awards are being held virtually so there’s no actual venue for the awards. All performances are virtual with artistes performing from their respective locations. Preparations are at an advanced stage and to hype people up, we’re running a countdown on our different websites and social media platforms. We’re trying to encourage Zimbabweans to watch this event in their numbers.” The event will be broadcast live on ZBCtv as well as the Nama, NACZ, Moysar and Zimcelebs Facebook pages. “It’s going to be an unforgettable experience with lots of excitement and surprises hence we encourage Zimbabweans to tune in and be part of this once in a lifetime event,” said Ruwende. A visibly excited Ammara, through a video drop that has been shared on the Nama Facebook page, said she is honoured to be presenting the awards. “When I heard they wanted me to host the Namas, I was pleasantly surprised because I’ve won so many awards but I’ve never hosted the event. This one is not just Namas but Nama legends awards. I’m looking forward to the event,” said Ammara. — @mthabisi_mthire.
