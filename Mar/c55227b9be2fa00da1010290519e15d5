Incumbent chairman Kenneth Mhlophe and Johnfat Sibanda are vying for the club’s chairmanship, while the secretary-general’s post is being contested by incumbent Israel Moyo and Victoria Falls-based Morgen “Gaza” Dube. With outgoing committee member Wisdom Mabhena ineligible to contest after serving two consecutive terms, Mgcini Mafu and Bheka Sibanda will lock horns for the position. <img class="alignnone wp-image-537214 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/bosso-meeting.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/bosso-meeting.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/bosso-meeting-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mhlophe said he wants to commence mining activities that will give the club financial stability, conclude projects that they had initiated to avoid reliance on a single sponsor as well as strengthen the junior structures by hiring qualified personnel who will infuse the“Bosso philosophy” to the youngsters. <img class="alignnone wp-image-537209 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Bosso-AGM2-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Bosso-AGM2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Bosso-AGM2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “The past Highlanders’ chairpersons were given two terms so that they build from the foundation they had set and I appeal for your votes for another term to finish the projects that we had started to make Bosso great again,” said Mhlophe. Sibanda, whose campaign has been centred on taking Highlanders to the people through greater participation by its members to enable the club to achieve glory, spoke passionately about the junior policy and commercialisation of all Bosso entities so that they are profitable. He believes the Highlanders grounds can also generate revenue for the club. <img class="wp-image-537207 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Bosso-high-table-AGM-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Bosso-high-table-AGM.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Bosso-high-table-AGM-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Luke Mnkandla (left), Modern Ngwenya and Donald Ndebele follow proceedings yesterday “I know the culture of the club. At Highlanders we’re one, all members are equal and if voted in, I’ll give respect. I don’t know what factions are. I’ve worked for Highlanders since 1986, working with different chairpersons and records are there that for the first time that the clubhouse made profits, Johnfat Sibanda was head of the entities committee. I promise that I’ll bring back exciting football,” said Sibanda. Moyo expressed his gratitude for serving as secretary and offered his services for another term. “It’s a privilege to serve Highlanders. Elections are exciting; sometimes they divide people, but elections are just an event where people express preference for one candidate over another. If I don’t win, I’ll revert to serve from the house, as I enjoyed doing so before I became the secretary,” Moyo said. <img class="wp-image-424164 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/Israel-Moyo-Indecent-assault.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="377" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/Israel-Moyo-Indecent-assault.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/Israel-Moyo-Indecent-assault-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Israel Moyo Dube, a former Zifa Southern Region vice-chairman, said he is bringing his expertise to help the club. “Ngicela ukulikhokhela hatshi ukulibusa. I have football experience as well as the technical know-how as I’m also a qualified coach. I believe my contribution will benefit my club. Voting for Morgen Dube, is voting for football first and I know that the core business of Highlanders is football,” said Dube. <img class="alignnone wp-image-537205 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Morgan-Gazza-Dube-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Morgan-Gazza-Dube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Morgan-Gazza-Dube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bheka Sibanda was brief, saying: “I’m offering myself to serve the club as a committee member. Some of you know my contribution to the club and I’m asking for your votes.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-537267 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Bheka-Sibanda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Bheka-Sibanda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Bheka-Sibanda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mafu said if voted in, he will encourage revisiting of chapters. <img class="wp-image-525674 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Mgcini-Mafu-final-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Mgcini-Mafu-final.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Mgcini-Mafu-final-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mgcini Mafu “I’m asking for your support so that we work together. Highlanders is in my DNA and having served the club from the periphery, I know what is expected of a committee member. Once voted in, I’ll lobby that we revive the membership drive and go to chapters because that’s where the money to help Highlanders is,” said Mafu. — @ZililoR
