THE Coca-Cola Foundation has announced the achievement of the Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN) whose goal is to improve access to clean water for six million people across Africa. RAIN is The Coca-Cola Foundation (TCCF) flagship clean water programme launched in 2009, contributing to helping countries across the continent achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6). “Water security is critical to building resilient communities and economic empowerment across Africa,” said the multinational company in a statement. “As part of its week-long celebration of World Water Day (March 22), TCCF announced the achievement of the Replenish Africa Initiative’s (RAIN) goal to improve access to clean water for six million people. “Today’s six million persons achievement is the result of a collective effort from over 300 international and local public, private and civil society partners.” As part of the celebrations for World Water Day 2021, RAIN partners gathered virtually for a panel discussion to mark the achievement of the programme and share best practices for replication from the programme. “RAIN is a testament to the power of collective action. Working with our partners, RAIN’s transformative impact can be felt today in 4 000 African communities. “This programme drives impact for the Sustainable Development Goals and our focus on People, Communities, and the Environment,” said TCCF chair and president Mr Bea Perez. TCCF is the global philanthropic arm of The Coca-Cola Company. Since its inception in 1984, the foundation has given back more than $1 billion to enable the empowerment of women, enhance communities, protect the environment and educate scholars around the world.
