A 31-YEAR-OLD Bulawayo man who allegedly raped an 11-year-old girl has appeared in court. Patrick Mawende yesterday appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Rachel Mukanga facing two counts of rape. He was remanded in custody to tomorrow. Mawende pleaded not guilty saying the matter is being fabricated. The prosecutor, Mr Terence Chakabuda said last week, at a time not known by the State, Mawende raped the minor twice in a kitchen. The court heard that Mawende offered the complainant US$1 to conceal the vice which she accepted and bought chips. Mr Chakabuda said on another occasion last week the complainant was cooking in another kitchen used as a storeroom. “Mawende wrestled the victim to the floor before removing her pants. He had sexual intercourse with her twice without protection,” said Mr Chakabuda.-@waydenaido
