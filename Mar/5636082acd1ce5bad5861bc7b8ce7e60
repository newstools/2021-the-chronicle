Zimbabwe could find itself without representatives in the 2021/22 Caf inter-club competitions as a result of the 2020 season being cancelled after outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Zifa said they were awaiting advice from Caf on the way forward, but indications are that it might have to handpick a representative, especially for the Champions League. Zvishavane-based side FC Platinum are the reigning league champions, while Highlanders are holders of the Chibuku Super Cup, which automatically qualifies Bosso to represent the country in the Caf Confederation Cup, but the  Bulawayo giants turned down the opportunity, citing financial challenges, leaving the country with no representative in that competition. “We will stand guided by what Caf tells us. We have no correspondence from Caf on the criteria. We hope they will communicate at the appropriate time,” said Zifa communications and competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela. The 2021/22 Caf inter-club competitions are expected to get underway later this year. With the continent still grappling with the Covid-19 effects, which saw Caf coming up with strict protocols to prevent spread of the virus, it seems only well funded teams might be willing to take up the offer to represent the country. Platinum mining teams, FC Platinum,  Ngezi Platinum Stars and probably Chicken Inn are favourites to take up the two slots should Caf allow Zifa to invite interested teams.
