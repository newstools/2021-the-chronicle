A prominent bridal dressmaker, Yolanda Dube Bridal has closed shop for good after 10 years of providing the perfect wedding dresses for brides in Bulawayo and Zimbabwe as a whole. Working from Suburbs in Bulawayo, Yolanda Dube Bridal was the go-to place for many brides in the city to get tailor-made, affordable wedding dresses. No matter the budget, Yolanda Dube was the person to go to as she catered for every bride. But sadly after 10 years, she has decided to shut down permanently. Posting on the Yolanda Dube Bridal Facebook page, the company informed their clients of the sad news. “We regret to inform you that YD Bridal is now permanently closed. The decision to close down was certainly not an easy one. “We are grateful for the support from all the clients we worked with over the past 10 years. It was a pleasure to make many brides’ dreams come true. Great relationships were created and enjoyed with our customers and we would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your unwavering support through our journey,” the post read. The wedding industry has been hit hard by the Covid-19 scourge as weddings were banned for the better part of last year and also this year. This led to many couples cancelling their weddings affecting many wedding service providers as they lost revenue. <img class="alignnone wp-image-537133 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Bride-in-YBD-dress.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Bride-in-YBD-dress.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Bride-in-YBD-dress-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Contacted for a comment, Dube said: “Well, I can’t really get into the details right now, but it (closure) has to do with Covid-19 and that the wedding industry is down at the moment. I’m really going through a hard time.” After the announcement of the closure on social media, brides who worked with Yolanda Dube Bridal in the past expressed their sadness. “It’s so sad that you’re closing down, I hope you open up again in the future. I wish you nothing, but the best and I’m so privileged to be one of your brides who had their dress designed by you,” said Sithembiso Ngorima who wedded five years ago in Bulawayo. Another bride dismayed by the closure was one Karen Ncube. “So sad to hear this. My wedding gown that you made was the best highlight of our wedding. You were and still are amazing at what you do. I wish you all the best in the future,” said Ncube. Barbara Nkazimulo Sibanda Ncube said: “2017 I walked down the aisle in a beautiful princess gown made by you. Thank you so much for making my dream dress. You are such a beautiful human being, in and out. It was so lovely working with you. I hope you will reopen because I’m planning to have a 10-year anniversary and would love you to make my dress. Wish you nothing but the best and stay blessed,” said Ncube. Others encouraged Dube saying it was not the end of the road, but the opening of a new chapter in her life urging her to hold on.
