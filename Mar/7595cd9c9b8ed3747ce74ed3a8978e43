Veteran modelling instructor Sarah Mpofu has said the Covid-19 pandemic has been a blessing in disguise for her as it has afforded her the rare opportunity to bond with her grandchildren in Australia, something she is enjoying. Mpofu who travelled to Australia in December, 2019 to see her child, has not been able to return to Zimbabwe due to travel restrictions because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although she misses home, Mpofu said spending time with her grandchildren has been one of the most fulfilling experiences. “Their parents leave for nightshift and I remain taking care of them as their grandmother. I must say I’m really enjoying the whole experience. It’s been a break from my daily routine back home,” said Mpofu. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-537028" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/sara1.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="884" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/sara1.jpg 482w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/sara1-196x360.jpg 196w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/sara1-371x680.jpg 371w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" /> Last year, Mpofu celebrated her birthday in Australia owing to travel restrictions in that country. Despite her being away, she is still being remembered and honoured in her home country. Recently, Mpofu was honoured through murals of her that were painted by CaliGraph in Bulawayo. She said this was one of the most exciting honours she has been given. “I’m truly humbled and thrilled by the Iconic Living Woman honour and would like to express my gratitude to #GirlChildZW for this positive exposure with the hope that the mural gets people talking and eventually brings to an understanding, what my goals and services have always been about,” said Mpofu. Other than the murals, several of her products who graduated from the Fingers Modelling Academy have been paying homage to her. The founder of the successful modelling grooming school went on to thank parents and young people for believing in her dream. “I feel blessed that someone values what I do and hence challenged and motivated to try and keep up the standards, even in these trying times. “To the parents and young people who’ve believed in my dream, I say thank you. “I want the girl child to know that ‘a woman ill-prepared is a set up for failure,’” she said.
