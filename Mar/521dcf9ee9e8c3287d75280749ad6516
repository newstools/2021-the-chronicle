Preparations for Geraldine drama competitions are going on well with the finals slated for Bulawayo Theatre on April 10. The competition which is in its third edition, covers Bulawayo Metropolitan, Matabeleland South and North provinces. Last week, the provincial rounds kicked off in Matabeleland South where Jahunda Community Arts and Loxion Theatre group qualified for the finals. This weekend, four groups will be drawn from Bulawayo and Matabeleland North province to join the finals. Reigning champions, Bambelela Arts automatically have a spot in the finals making them the seventh participant. The competition uses drama and film to deliver messages and raise awareness on issues affecting communities while at the same time sharpening drama skills, especially for the youths. Geraldine Roche project coordinator, Khaliphile Sibanda said preparations for the competitions are going on well adding that they are expecting fireworks at the finals. “The first round of provincial finals went well as arts groups showed their best considering that they’d been out of action for a long time due to Covid-19 restrictions. “We’ll be wrapping up the provincial rounds this weekend,” said Sibanda. She said arts groups should take the competition as a platform to prepare themselves for national competitions. Last year’s winners, Bambelela Arts from Bulawayo starred in three plays which were a collaboration between Bulawayo-based Geraldine Roche and Harare’s Jasen Mphepo Little Theatre. — @mthabisi_mthire
