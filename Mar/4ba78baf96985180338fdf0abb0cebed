THE country’s only rugby stadium, Hartsfield Grounds is in a serious state of neglect. Last year, the facility went through a similar phase when it was left unattended and went for about four months without being watered after the ouster of the Craig Change-led Bulawayo Metropolitan Rugby Football Board (BMRFB). Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) vice-president Martin Shone blamed last year’s Hartsfield near state of derelict on a broken pump, but despite the recent good rains, the grounds have not been attended to and has been an eyesore. Both the main and outside grounds have overgrown grass, an indication that it has been long since groundsmen attended to the playing fields. The Zimbabwe Rugby Union tasked the interim BMRFB committee to carry out an audit of the board’s finances, restoration of rugby, Hartsfield ground and all related structures, and to ensure that there is a functional constitution in line with the mother body. The interim BMRFB committee is made up of chairman David Mhiribidi, former rugby players David Nash, Gregory Friend and Elliot Mandaza, accountant Maria Muzvidzwa as well as ex-Sports and Recreation Commission board member Farai Kanyangarara, who has previously served as Hockey Association of Zimbabwe president. The interim BMRFB committee mustn’t blame the Covid-19 enforced lockdown for neglecting the facility because Bulawayo City Council (BCC) has been attending to Barbourfields Stadium and Luveve Stadium. Popular football side Highlanders have been busy fixing their club house grounds, while there is no sign of life at Hartsfield. Hopefully some work will begin soon at Hartsfield to restore the playing field to its yesteryear standard while rugby remains among the suspended sports to ensure the venue is ready to host matches once the ban is lifted. — @ZililoR
