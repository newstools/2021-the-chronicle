THE Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) says the ball is in the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education’s court for sports to resume in schools. The SRC revealed on Monday schools have the green light to restart activities. The National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) and National Association of Primary School Heads (Naph) are working on a comprehensive document to convince the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to allow sports to resume in schools. The Ministry has reportedly blocked sports in schools because of Covid-19. Nash president Arthur Maphosa said they are working to convince their parent Ministry to allow sports resumption under strict Covid-19 protocols. Maphosa is hopeful that their application will be successful, as they want to start with athletics. “Presently, all sporting activities in schools are on hold, but Nash together with Naph are working on a document for us to be permitted to resume athletics under the same conditions that the SRC has cleared national sports associations. We desire to resume sporting activities because most kids have lost opportunities to travel and develop their talents. Last year we couldn’t stage the traditional Copa Coca-Cola and that age group of Under-15s has missed out,” said Maphosa. “By playing in competitions like Copa Coca-Cola, kids get an opportunity to travel to East Africa and learn other cultures so, we hope the Ministry will allow us to resume activities.” Besides the Coca-Cola funded premier schools’ football tournament, Naph and Nash athletes also compete in the annual regional Cossasa Games, a competition for primary and secondary school athletes from Southern Africa. – @ZililoR
