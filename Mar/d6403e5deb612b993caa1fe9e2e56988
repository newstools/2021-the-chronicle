The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter A 32-YEAR-OLD Lupane man who pounced on a 78-year-old woman and attempted to rape her in a bush has been sentenced to 36 months in jail. Bright Bhukanana Moyo (32) of Gudubhu village had met the woman who cannot be named for ethical reasons, walking through a bush. He pinned her to the ground in an attempt to rape her but when she screamed a neighbour rushed to the scene and he fled. Moyo was convicted on his own plea of guitly to attempted rape when he appeared before Lupane resident magistrate Mr Ndumo Masuku. Mr Masuku slapped Moyo with 36 months in jail before suspending six months for five years on condition of good behaviour. Moyo will rue the day he chose to commit the crime as he will serve an effective 30 months in prison. The magistrate said the courts had a duty to protect vulnerable members of the society such as the elderly and children from abuse. “The court considered that the accused molested an old woman whose age is close to three times his. Elderly people are vulnerable just like children and are supposed to be protected as opposed to being targeted for self satisfaction. The accused person’s actions towards this elderly woman cannot be condoned. Had it not been for the other villager who promptly came to the complainant’s rescue, she could have been raped. The accused thus deserves a lengthy sentence, ” said Mr Masuku. Prosecuting, Mr Clive Gumbo said Moyo wrestled the woman to the ground intending to rape her. “On 18 February, the accused met the complainant in a bushy area in Gudubhu. He grabbed her by the body and wrestled her to the ground,” said Mr Gumbo. The complainant screamed and a neighbour whose name has also been concealed, rushed to the scene. Moyo fled when he saw her approaching. Both women managed to identify Moyo and reported the matter to the police leading to his arrest. -@ncubeleon
