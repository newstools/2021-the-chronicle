The Chronicle TELL us about yourself.
I am Kudzai Chikowore, a proud owner of a unique line of a business group that is centred around beauty, tourism and hospitality. Born and raised in a small town but growing in leaps and bounds from Midlands and beyond. What motivated you to start your business? I saw a gap in the market (beauty industry in the Midlands) and having travelled outside the country a few times I was exposed to world class standards in the beauty industry that I admired. It was then that my sister and I decided to come up with Sisters Beauty Parlour and offer world class service at an affordable price. The concept behind sisters is bringing together all sorts of women, that is sisters in a place they can relax in an environment that fosters a well-groomed lady. You will be surprised how much networking is done at Sisters. We strive to help our customer to put their wellness first and put their best “look” forward. Have you faced any challenges in starting your business? Yes! It all started with a satchel and a focused, free-spirited young lady. One of the biggest challenges was possibly getting people to buy into my idea. Having people who support you becomes very important for you to get what you want. Another one perhaps the biggest is high rentals, I have learnt the hard way that obtaining your own property may be painful but it is worth it. I have also suffered from occurrences from those with pull her down syndrome (PHD).lol. It’s real and true in most cases it’s fellow sisters that pull each other down from jealousy or greed etecetera. Did you have a business background when you started? No, I have always been enterprising but I did marketing which contributes largely to how I have carved my way in the market. What characteristics do you posses that you consider to have contributed to your success? I have a strong Christian background, before anything we do . . . We pray. I am sociable and principled person. I keep my ear on the ground and I am quick to make decisions according to what will be happening on the ground. My experience over the years has taught me to keep an open mind and endurance. This industry requires one to be focused and steadfast remembering that quality over quantity is everything. What advice can you give other entrepreneurs just starting? -Find out what you have a passion for and follow it.
– Never think small, think big always.
-Ignore people who discourage you.
-Work very hard because no pain, no gain.
– In business don’t just take, give back. How has being in business affected your family life? It hasn’t surprisingly enough, in fact, it has cemented our bond as brothers and sisters working together, we literally move as one. My sister Memory works at the beauty parlour, Kuda, my brother is at the training college and Shepard is our operations and logistics to glue all the units together. My family makes all the challenges I face easier to tackle. We are working on a dream our late mother laid out for us, so everything which comes our way is worth it. Do you have any words of encouragement to your fellow sisters? Don’t compare yourself to others, start where you are. Don’t let anyone intimidate you. Anyone can be anything. How far are you willing to go to succeed and achieve your goals? There is an old saying that goes . . . “The sky is the limit . . . But I personally think that the saying should be ‘The sky is only the beginning’.” What else do you want to say in closing? This is just the beginning for Kudzai Chikowore, brace yourself for a sister who is set apart and ready to take on the world. What I know is this, “I can definitely do all things through Christ who strengthens me . . .”
