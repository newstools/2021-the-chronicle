HUNDRED-YEAR-OLD Khulu Richard Ncube takes a one-kilometre walk every morning in Barbourfields suburb where he lives with his grandchild. Khulu Ncube attributes his old age to healthy habits which include exercise. As he turned 100 years old last week on Wednesday, a local organisation, SPA Community Trust threw a birthday party for the centenarian. The organisation which is based in Bulawayo targets old people aged above 65 with essentials such as food and health care especially those living with non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Khulu Ncube’s birthday party was graced by Bulawayo Provincial Affairs Minister Judith Ncube, Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Raj Modi and Bulawayo deputy mayor Councillor Mlandu Ncube. The centenarian who has seven children and 25 grandchildren said he walks at least a kilometre every morning in Barbourfields. Two of his children are now late and he has 37 great-grandchildren who have so far borne his six great-great-grandchildren. The ever-smiling centenarian can read and write and can still see, hear and walk upright with an aide of a walking stick. “I am grateful to be alive at a time when most of my peers have left this world and I cannot over emphasise the need for one to take good care of their bodies so they remain healthy. I went to Lozikeyi Primary School back in the day and then proceeded to Empandeni Mission to further my studies. “I take pride in eating healthy food which is also courtesy of SPA organisation and I know that healthy food will reduce my chances of being affected by non-communicable diseases. I have also learnt that eating lots of okra is very beneficial in many ways,” says Khulu Ncube. He said among the things he can share as tips to a good and healthy life is that smoking must be eliminated from humanity. “I think it’s possible for one to lead a healthy life if they eat clean and exercise. Smoking however, is a very common practice which I think is the reason why there are many ailments in this world. I am still fit as a fiddle and I know that at this rate I can even reach 150.” Khulu Ncube extended his gratitude to SPA for the care they offer to the elderly saying it will go a long way in ensuring they age in peace and happiness. <img class="wp-image-538378 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/khulu-ncube-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/khulu-ncube-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/khulu-ncube-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Khulu Richard Ncube In an interview SPA director Mrs Nokuthula Ndlovu said it was important for the community to take care of its elderly who are also prone to NCDs. “We have been aboard for over 19 years and we come back and having embraced the UK approach of taking care of the elderly, we decided to introduce it here in Bulawayo. We are focusing on elderly with NCDs basically and we help with awareness, medication, meals and social programmes to keep them happy,” said Mrs Ndlovu. “In our database we have 365 which we have divided into groups targeting the most vulnerable. We take them outside their homes to have social life so they are not lonely and we work in partnership with the national University of Science and Technology, Ministry of Health and Child Care Ingwebu Breweries, Bulawayo City Council and the Events Company.” She said from her interaction with the elderly in Bulawayo, lack of access to proper medication and a balanced diet remains the greatest challenge for the elderly. “We realised that our elderly suffer from a number of the NCDs but do not have adequate information on how to manage these chronic conditions which often leads to unnecessary deaths. Since our opening last year in May we have dealt with a few numbers as we would like to maintain the international standard but with more support and donation, we know we will be able to roll this out to all the elderly in different parts of the country,” she added. Mrs Ndlovu said she was happy that one of the partners had promised to avail at least two balanced meals for the vulnerable elders weekly to ensure they recover from the ailments. Currently a team from SPA Community Trust is conducting clinics every Tuesdays and Thursdays at Mpilo Central Hospital where elders with NCDs are being supported. The extent of poverty and the huge gap of support for the NCDs in the community is sadly emerging from the conducted clinics, said Mrs Ndlovu. Speaking during the centenarian’s birthday, Cde Ncube said having Khulu Ncube is something to treasure. “They play a key role in teaching our youths cultural values and preserving tradition as they are the guardians of a rich cultural heritage. Although their bodies may be becoming weak, they have an immense ocean of experience and wisdom,” said Minister Ncube. “If we are willing to listen and learn from them, we will realise that their importance transcends storytelling. As Government we acknowledge contributions of older persons to societies. As we move towards achieving an upper middle-income economy under Vision 2030, we envisage increased life expectancy and having more centenarians in the country.” — @thamamoe
