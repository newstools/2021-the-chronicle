During the memorial service National Arts Council of Zimbabwe executive director, Nicholas Moyo presented Rashid Jogee’s family with the trophy. He said it was not a post humous presentation, but he had already been selected to receive the award at the NAMAs Legends @40 ceremony on March 27. Moyo said the last time he spoke to Rashid Jogee was the previous week informing him that he had been selected as one of the 40 legends and was supposed to be presented with the gong. “I had a conversation with Rashid, was on February 27 and I was calling him to congratulate him as he had been selected by Zimbabwe, to receive an honour, for the creative industries where the Government of Zimbabwe, through the National Arts Council will honour 40 legends, those that had an impact. “Not just that their art has been good, but they had an impact in their communities and mentored people, so Rashid was one of them. So, I was telling him that we were supposed to be in Bulawayo this week and present the award tomorrow (last Sunday) and he was so excited about that. He insisted that we present his award at his home,” said Moyo. Thereafter, the award was presented to the Jogee family, by Chief Director Ministry of Youth, Sports, Arts and Recreation Dr Benson Dube. <img class="wp-image-535508 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Chief-Director-Ministry-of-Youth-Sports-Arts-and-Recreation-Dr-Benson-Dube-presenting-the-award-to-Ahmed-Mia-Jogee-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Chief-Director-Ministry-of-Youth-Sports-Arts-and-Recreation-Dr-Benson-Dube-presenting-the-award-to-Ahmed-Mia-Jogee.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Chief-Director-Ministry-of-Youth-Sports-Arts-and-Recreation-Dr-Benson-Dube-presenting-the-award-to-Ahmed-Mia-Jogee-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Director Ministry of Youth, Sports, Arts and Recreation Dr Benson Dube presenting the award to Ahmed Mia Jogee His brother, Ahmed Mia Jogee received the award on behalf of the family and thanked organisers for honouring Rashid Jogee. Speaking for the family, Rashid Jogee’s nephew, Mohammed said his uncle loved his family and introduced him to the world of art and he will be sorely missed. <img class="wp-image-535515 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Ahmed-Mia-Jogee.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Ahmed-Mia-Jogee.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Ahmed-Mia-Jogee-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ahmed Mia Jogee “He was a man who was out of this world. He was very family orientated; he loved his family. He took great pride in caring for his family. I remember as a child growing up, he had a studio at the back of his home. “While playing there he used to give us charcoal pieces and paper to draw and to write on. We used to play with his paint and allow us to do whatever we needed to do. “I do a bit of art as well I think it took it from him. I don’t do it professionally but as a pastime and I hope to carry on with the art and keep the Jogee’s name in the art gallery,” said Mohammed before tailing off as he shed tears for his uncle. The Executive Director of the National Gallery of Zimbabwe Raphael Chikukwa said Rashid Jogee will be missed and the country has been robbed. <img class="wp-image-535511 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/The-Executive-Director-of-the-National-Gallery-of-Zimbabwe-Raphael-Chikukwa-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/The-Executive-Director-of-the-National-Gallery-of-Zimbabwe-Raphael-Chikukwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/The-Executive-Director-of-the-National-Gallery-of-Zimbabwe-Raphael-Chikukwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Executive Director of the National Gallery of Zimbabwe Raphael Chikukwa “We are standing here looking at these powerful works that Rashid has left for us. These works will live forever. Let’s celebrate them. Let’s care about these works because we shall be caring about Rashid’s legacy. These works will remain there for the generation to come to show that the visual artistes dedicated to the art was more than you and me expect. “To the family, please value what Rashid has left with you, that number 144 Fort Street, means a lot to us the artistes not here in Zimbabwe but across the world,” said Chikukwa. NGZ regional director, Butholezwe Nyathi said the gallery would like to preserve Rashid Jogee’s work. “Zimbabwe has lost a talented abstract artist. We have in our collection artworks by Rashid Jogee. The National Gallery in Bulawayo is keen to collect more of Rashid’s work and preserve his legacy for future generations,” said Nyathi. Also, during the memorial service Former NGZ regional director Voti Thebe, who alongside Rashid Jogee, represented Zimbabwe at the Venice Biennale in 2013, described as the world cup of visual art. He said Rashid Jogee was a charismatic and thoughtful individual who loved what he did, art. “Jogee suffered with us during the colonial times and he was always ready to appreciate the complexity of our daily experience; with an ability of self-reflection. He has forged new identities in the midst of rapid change, that is Rashid,” said Thebe. His personal friend, Berry Bickle said part of Rashid Jogee’s legacy was the NGZ in Bulawayo building as they were the first artistes to occupy the gallery. <img class="wp-image-535513 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Berry-Bickle-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Berry-Bickle.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Berry-Bickle-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Berry Bickle She said she remembers fondly when Rashid Jogee hugged the then president of Zimbabwe, the late Robert Mugabe at the NGZ in Harare. “At the awards ceremony at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Harare where he was being given the award by the late president, Rashid went up the ramp and hugged the president. It was a moment of absolute suspension. No body knew what to do, not a soldier, not a sectary officer, not the president himself, time was absolutely suspended. How did he do it. But yet he did it,” said Bickle. Also in attendance were fellow artistes such as Shamilla Asha, Charles Nkomo and Charles Msimanga, who gave heart felt condolence messages and vivid accounts of their encounters with Rashid Jogee. <img class="wp-image-535514 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Shamilla-Asha.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Shamilla-Asha.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Shamilla-Asha-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Shamilla Asha Born in Bulawayo on February 11, 1951, Rashid Jogee started painting at the age of nineteen.
