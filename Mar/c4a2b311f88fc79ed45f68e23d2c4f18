The Chronicle Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Court Reporter CHIEF Justice Luke Malaba has lifted the ban on weddings and announced the resumption of normal court operations, including the offices of the Master and the Sheriff of the High Court following the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions by President Mnangagwa on Monday. CJ Malaba suspended all regular court operations, including solemnisation of marriages, and scaled down other courthouse activities following the announcement of the level four lockdown in January by Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga. The Sheriff and Messenger of Court were also ordered to stop evictions and executions, following the extended lockdown. Courts were operating under a special regime as the country was battling to contain rising Covid-19 cases especially after the festive season. In a statement, CJ Malaba said solemnisation of marriages should be conducted on condition that only the parties to the marriage and their witnesses attend. “The filing and processing of new cases, process, documents, pleadings, papers and court orders, including service and execution by the Sheriff and the Messenger of Court, shall be done in terms of the applicable Court Rules, legislation or court order,” he said.
