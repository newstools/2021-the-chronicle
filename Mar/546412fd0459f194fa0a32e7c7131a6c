No matter how much money I make, it still hits me that she’s no more so I decided to work on this track with other artistes to express our love and appreciation to all mothers out there. “I featured Bhadilah, a Venda artiste in order to preach unity as he sang in his language. Basically, we want to spread the message to different people.” Jaycee Rappadict who is on a quest to create a brand for himself recently released his debut album which was meant to introduce his solo career. – @mthabisi_mthire
