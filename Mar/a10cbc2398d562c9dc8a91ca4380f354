The Chronicle A Liverpool fan has bizarrely blamed the red seat coverings for the side’s alarmingly poor home form — claiming the backdrop “takes the team longer to visualise players”. Jurgen Klopp’s Reds have lost their last six home league games after being defeated 1-0 by Chelsea on Thursday, and losing by a similar margin to Fulham at Anfield on Sunday. It is the first time they have lost six in a row at home in their history and also makes them the first English top-flight champions to go on such a run. It’s safe to say his take was not well received by presenters Andy Goldstein and Perry Groves. The hosts made the point that Man United were going strong in second despite having the same red backdrop, while Merseyside rivals Everton have blue seat coverings and aren’t similarly struggling at the moment. Frank continued: “If you’re making a painting and you put a red colour on top of a red, it actually looks worse than blue on blue. “I can guarantee if Liverpool changed their backdrop to their away kit, they would perform a lot better. “Even if it only made a 10 percent difference, in the scheme of things 10 percent is a lot.” The fan’s strange excuse will conjure up memories of Sir Alex Ferguson ordering his Manchester United players to swap their kit colours at half time during their 1996 clash at Southampton. The team were 3-0 down at the break and the Scot insisting the players could not see each other well enough in their grey strip. The Red Devils emerged in a blue and white kit after the interval, but still went on to lose the game 3-1. — Reuters
