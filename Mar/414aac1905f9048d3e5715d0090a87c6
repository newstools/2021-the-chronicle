BULAWAYO Arts Awards (BAA) 2020 Outstanding DJ, DJ Yugoe has followed up on his win by releasing a track that features his Plumtree homeboy Babongile Sibanda. The track titled Buyisa, is DJ Yugoe’s fourth single and was released on March 12 with the visuals expected to be out in the coming fortnight. DJ Yugoe (real name Dumisani Magalane) said the track touches deeply on a love relationship that has failed. “On Buyisa I featured the talented Babongile Sibanda from Plumtree. I did the production part and it was recorded in Plumtree. If all goes well the music video will be out before mid-April. Handy Sibanda has made this possible through his hard work as the manager of the two brands,” he said. DJ Yugoe said he is not taking the back seat in growing his brand as winning an award has inspired him to work even harder. “Since winning the BAA, I have upped my game and this has seen me dropping the single Twai Warrior featuring Hwabaraty on the 18th of December 2020. “My other singles are The Lost Sangoma released on the 9th of June 2020 while my debut single was The Morning Dove featuring Dolly K and was released on the 18th of November 2019,” he said. Turning to his musical journey, DJ Yugoe said he began his deejaying career in 2010 where he played at High School events in Plumtree then later became professional with the help of Bhabha and Cooldread. “What inspired the move is the love of music and looking up to DJ Fresh (SA). “As for my brand Yugoe, it is a name my brother used to call me when I was a little boy and so I took it up from there,” said DJ Yugoe. — @mthabisi_mthire
