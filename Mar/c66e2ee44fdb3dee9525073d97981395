THE National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) successfully staged its first event of the year when more than 100 athletes took part in the National Open Championships held at White City Stadium on Saturday. The competition was conducted under strict Covid-19 prevention protocols. Host province, Bulawayo Athletics Board chairperson Watson Madanyika, said: “The event was well attended, we had athletes from all corners of the country. Athletes and coaches were happy because they can now go and work on improving their times and also improve their techniques. We had 150 athletes who registered and 120 athletes managed to attend the event. “Athletes hoping to attain World Junior Championships and Olympic times got an opportunity to fine tune their preparations. Now that the competition is done, we intend to send athletes with good times to Zambia so that they push for Olympic qualification and other international meets.” Madanyika said their next project is on the BAB track and field open championship that will be held on April 10 at White City Stadium. This event is not on the calendar but Naaz said they had drafted it in so that athletes participate in as many competitions as they can to get back into shape. — @innocentskizoe
