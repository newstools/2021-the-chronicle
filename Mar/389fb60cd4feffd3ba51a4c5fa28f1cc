The Chronicle ARSENAL produced another fightback as three goals in 17 minutes either side of half-time gave them a 3-1 victory at Leicester to prevent the Foxes moving second. After two late goals earned them a dramatic Europa League win over Benfica in midweek, Arsenal had to come from behind again yesterday to earn three points at the King Power Stadium. Youri Tielemans put Leicester ahead (6 min) with a good finish into the bottom left corner, thanks to some wide-open, poor Arsenal defending, but the visitors levelled through David Luiz’s clever header from a Willian free-kick (39 min). VAR had earlier correctly denied Arsenal a penalty for Wilfred Ndidi’s nudge on Pepe, just outside the box, but the two were involved again as Pepe’s shot struck Ndidi’s hand in the box, spotted by VAR, allowing Alexandre Lacazette to score from the spot (45+2 min). Pepe extended Arsenal’s lead with a simple close-range finish from Willian’s centre (52 min), in a game where both sides felt the impact of Thursday’s Europa League games as Emile Smith Rowe, Jonny Evans and Harvey Barnes all went off injured. The result means Leicester stay third, with Chelsea six points behind but with a game in hand, while Arsenal are up to ninth above Tottenham for a few hours at least. — Sky Sports
