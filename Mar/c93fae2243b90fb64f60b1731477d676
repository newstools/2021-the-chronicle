The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter THE Zimbabwe Miners Federation (ZMF) has amended its constitution with the tenure of executive council membership reviewed from three to five years. ZMF chief executive officer, Mr Wellington Takavarasha, said the amendment follows a resolution that was passed during a special general council meeting held in Kwekwe in 2019. “There was a special general council meeting on the 11th of April in 2019 in Kwekwe, which passed a resolution to amend the ZMF Constitution. “So, last week people came to Harare and a draft of the amended constitution was done, and that draft was ratified by 55 associations out of 60,” he said. As part of the amendments of its constitution, ZMF has reduced the number of vice presidents from two to one while the number of regional representatives has been increased from seven to eight. “The old constitution was archaic, it was promulgated in 1923. So, we have noted the need to amend it in line with what is happening in the country,” said Mr Takavarasha. – @okazunga
