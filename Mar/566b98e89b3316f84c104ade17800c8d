The Chronicle Nelias Shiri, Chronicle Reporter A 42-YEAR-OLD man and two accomplices allegedly broke into Monarch Steel Company in Bulawayo and stole property worth more than $100 000. Jabulani Nkomo from Makokoba Suburb allegedly teamed up with Mkhululi Moyo and Lalenani Ncube, who are still at large, to steal zinc sheets and lock boxes. He pleaded not guilty to one count of theft before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Rachel Mukanga who granted him $6 000 bail. He would be back in court on March 24. Ms Mukanga ordered Nkomo not to interfere with State witnesses and to continue residing at the given address until the matter is finalised. He was also ordered to report once every fortnight at Mzilikazi Police Station between 6AM-6PM. Prosecuting, Mr Terence Chakabuda said on March 14 at around 9PM Nkomo and his two accomplices hatched a plan to steal from Monarch Steel Company. “Mkhululi and Lalenani jumped over the main gate leaving Nkomo outside the premises. They gained entry to the storeroom after using an unknown object to forcefully break the main door. In the process, they took 56x zinc sheets and 149 lock boxes,” said Mr Chakabuda. The court heard that the security guard, Jotham Ndlovu of Entumbane suburb, saw Nkomo receiving the stolen property over the precast wall. Ndlovu advised his bosses, leading to the arrest of Nkomo at the scene. The stolen property is valued at $101 311 and it was all recovered. @waydenaido
