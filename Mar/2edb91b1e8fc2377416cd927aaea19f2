The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent MUSIC label Ibrah Music has brought together young and upcoming artistes to collaborate on a track titled R.O.A.E (Rise Of An Empire) as a way of introducing the musicians to the big scene of the music corridors.

Ibrah said his label which focuses on artiste management, recording tracks and promoting local talent will use the track to uplift the upcoming artistes. “The track is about Bulawayo as a whole, our lifestyle, the beauty, the talent and how we live our lives in Bulawayo. That’s why I decided to title it R.O.A.E (Rise Of An Empire) as I feel like Bulawayo music industry is now going out there as we rising. “I have been in the music industry since 2017 but I wasn’t dropping songs like other artistes. I have produced songs for artists like the late Cal Vin and South African based Ice King,” he said. Ibrah said as a brand after going through the works of some upcoming artistes he felt the need to play his part in making a breakthrough for his label and the selected artistes and uplift the city in the process. “I have been listening to most local music and I discovered that every artiste is just working on their own music projects, everyone is just focused on his/her brand but at the end of the day we have to work together to put Bulawayo somewhere. “So, I’m making this so that we get to work with each other and support each other in our industry. We are planning to release the track at the end of this month and if all goes well, we plan to release the video soon also,” said Ibrah. – @mthabisi_mthire
