The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Chronicle Reporter PEOPLE with disabilities account for 10 percent of the country’s population and yet only a handful of them are in decision making positions due to stigma. The outbreak of the global pandemic has worsened their plight, leaving thousands with no access to basics like food hence their leadership and political aspirations have become improbable. On Monday, Zimbabwe joined the whole world in commemorating the International Women’s Day (IWD) amid calls for policy makers to make the political environment conducive for women with disabilities. Ms Sukoluhle Mhlanga who represents young women with disability in the Women’s Coalition said women with disabilities are not anywhere close to politics as members of the public still believe they are a curse from angry gods and a charity case hence they cannot lead in anything. “As a disability activist our greatest challenge remains misconceptions and describing your beliefs that people still hold about us. The few women with disabilities that are in leadership were given those roles just to fulfill policy and have people thinking that we are represented in different bodies,” says Ms Mhlanga. “Many think we are a charity case and even if we are capable to lead and participate in politics, we do not get the chance. We need to change perceptions on people with disabilities especially women so that they are able to actively take leadership positions,” she adds. Ms Mhlanga said the Covid-19 pandemic worsened gender inequalities. For Ms Soneni Gwizi a gender and disability activist, achieving an equal future in a Covid-19 world needs combined efforts from policy makers and members of the public. “Celebrating IWD2021 as a woman leader with a disability under covid-19 is a very sad reality and honestly it is not a happy celebration for me. I am reflecting on how most women with disabilities have been sidelined in leadership opportunities, education, health access, employment and social interaction,” said Ms Gwizi. <img class="wp-image-534997 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Soneni-Gwizi-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Soneni-Gwizi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Soneni-Gwizi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Soneni Gwizi “This has been worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, I’m encouraging society to push for inclusion in all societal sectors in order for future celebrations to be more meaningful for women with disabilities. We need mentorship programs for women with disabilities to meet them at their point of level of understanding and disability needs,” she added. Ms Gwizi said in order to achieve this people need to get rid of the charity model which is used by most sectors when promoting issues of women with disabilities. “We have the women and we are celebrating the few that have reached the top but we can do more,” she adds. Ms Alice Chimwanza who represents women with disabilities says the global pandemic worsened their conditions as many are now struggling to access food. “Society is still discriminatory and the only things we are known for is to sell wares which is our only source of income. With lockdowns we were forced off the streets and now we live off handouts,” says Ms Chimwanza. “It is difficult to discuss how we can take up leadership positions when we do not know where the next meal is going to come from. We wish for an inclusive environment where we are considered and then we can talk about celebrating women’s day as for now we do not feel like we are treated like every Zimbabwean woman,” she adds. Ms Margaret Saungweme from the National Council of the Disabled said lockdown regulations made it hard for her to eke a living as she relies heavily on plaiting people and selling wares on the streets. She added that using a wheelchair caused a lot of problems as she could not easily access buses to at least go buy food for her family. “We have been grounded since the first 2020 lockdown and I struggle to access clients as I also do hairdressing to supplement my income.  Now I cannot even afford data to participate in Zoom meeting or even WhatsApp hence we have been left behind. I heard the Cabinet has approved a Disability Bill but I haven’t seen it because I need data to be able to access and even make recommendations to Parliament,” says Saungweme. In a statement, the Zimbabwe Gender Commission said systemic barriers to women and girls’ participation and representation in leadership and decision-making positions persist even globally. “Statistics show that women and girls continue to be denied opportunities to take up leadership positions in socio-cultural, economic and political spaces despite constitutional guarantees. This is also a time for institutions to introspect and consider meaningful ways of promoting women into leadership and decision-making positions,” said the ZGC. The commission added that is common cause that in any pandemic, the vulnerable groups of women and girls, the elderly and persons with disabilities, among others, are more affected as they lack voice, choice and control over their destiny. @thamamoe
