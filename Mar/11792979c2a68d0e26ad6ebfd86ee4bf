The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter SOUTHERN Region Division One coaches have welcomed moves by the regional board to push for the immediate return of football. Unlike Premier Soccer League sides that had at least had resumed training before the second ban of all sporting activities, lower division football has been in limbo since March last year. Lower division coaches had expressed worry that some players might quit the game due to frustration and the need to eke out a living. With recent strong calls for the immediate return of football, the Zifa Southern Region board has put in motion processes for the imminent return of the game, with the competitions committee having drawn up fixtures for the 2021 season. Mosi Rovers coach Try Ncube said: “This is good news indeed. At least there is some movement to try and save football in the country.” Arenel coach Kudzayi Mhandire said they were depressed since football is their source of livelihoods. “Hopefully the authorities will eventually open football so that we return to our job of entertaining people. We are happy that at last things seem to be going back to normal,” said Mhandire. The Sports and Recreation Commission is preparing for the resumption of sporting activity, with low risk sports likely to resume in the next few weeks. President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Monday announced new lockdown regulations, which brought hope to the sporting industry after a relaxation of lockdown regulations that now allow inter-city travel. In a statement, the SRC said following the easing of the lockdown, consultations were underway for the possible resumption of sport in the country. – @innocentskizoe
