THE community of Sinyombo Village in Mbondweni area under Chief Tshulugu in Nkayi District, Matabeleland North, has constructed a stone dam wall across Shangani River to harness water from the water body. The water from Shangani River, one of the biggest rivers in the country, is being used to irrigate community gardens and fishing. Villagers’ livestock also drink from the water source. Villagers said the project was mooted following recurrent droughts, which affected their livestock. The project was finished in June last year. The spilling of the water from one of the pools in the river, has also created a spectacular little waterfall. Nkayi is regarded as one of the highly impoverished districts in the country in urgent need of support to improve livelihoods. A recent independent baseline assessment survey report commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), indicated that the district has a poverty prevalence rate of 95,6 percent in almost every ward. With many people surviving on subsistence agriculture, life has not been easy for most households given the reality of climate change and low rainfall patterns, which have over the years negatively affected yields. Nkayi District is characterised by low and erratic rainfall, hit by frequent droughts and intra-seasonal dry spells. The previous drought situation was worse in Nkayi District than the rest of Zimbabwe because of poor soil fertility. Ms Glady Ncube of Sinyombo Village hopes that the project will boost food and livestock production in the district. “We have been facing perennial water challenges since time immemorial particularly during the dry season as Shangani River, our main source of water, would be completely dry. However, following the construction of a stone wall, we are now able to harness water for irrigation purposes and for our livestock as well,” she said. Another local villager, Mr Misheck Ndlovu said the good rains recorded in the country have also resulted in an increased volume of water in the river and more fish. <img class="alignnone wp-image-538177 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Mthangaleni-Nkayi-beauty-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Mthangaleni-Nkayi-beauty-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Mthangaleni-Nkayi-beauty-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “This community project has come in handy for people in this area as we are now able to get fish. I come here every day to do fishing and this year we have been blessed with plenty of fish because of the water that has been harnessed through the construction of the wall,” he said. Ms Nomqhele Ngwenya said: “I am a widow and since my husband passed on three years ago, I have been struggling to fend for my four minor children. However, with this project, I am now surviving on selling fish and produce from my small horticulture project.” Nkayi Rural District Council vice-chairperson Councillor Lot Fuzwayo said some of the long-term plans include developing a massive irrigation farming project. “We want to transform lives of the local community through capacitating them. The community of Mbondweni came together and constructed a stone wall with the assistance of a local NGO and our long-term plan is to have a thriving irrigation scheme,” he said. “People in Nkayi rely on cattle farming and you will find that during the dry season water was a challenge for their livestock thus threatening the very essence of their survival. The community has managed to harness water through this project and there are certainly guaranteed of a constant water supply throughout the year.” Clr Fuzwayo said although Nkayi is regarded as the country’s poorest district, it has a potential for economic growth due to its strategic location. “We have natural resources such as timber and we are strategically located between key cities such as Bulawayo and Kwekwe. However, the state of our roads is hindering development in the district. Our main road to Bulawayo is in a bad state and equally the Nkayi-Kwekwe road needs attention,” he said. — @mashnets
