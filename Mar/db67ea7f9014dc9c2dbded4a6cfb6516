WARRIORS captain Knowledge Musona will join the national team camp today bubbling with confidence after scoring his seventh goal for his Belgian side AS Eupen in their win over Kortrijk on Saturday night. Musona is expected to bring his club form to the national team that will take on Botswana in a penultimate Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) group stage match on Thursday at the Obed Itani Chilume Stadium in Francistown. With an array of United Kingdom-based Zimbabwean footballers as well as the France pair of striker Tinotenda Kadewere and Marshal Munetsi unavailable for the crunch Afcon qualifiers due to Covid-19, The Smiling Assassin, as Musona is fondly known, will carry Zimbabwe’s scoring hopes. Wellington Mpandare, national team manager said they expect Musona to be part of the third group of players called up for duty that will report for camp today.
