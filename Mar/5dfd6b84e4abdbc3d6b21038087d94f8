The Chronicle THE Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) has granted listed companies with financial results due out at the end of this month, a 30-day reprieve within which to publish them. The extension, the bourse said, followed various representations it had received from firms owing to disturbances caused as a result of the Covid-19-induced lockdowns. Zimbabwe was for two months since January under a Level 4 lockdown as the Government sought to contain the spread of the ravaging virus which has slowed down economic activity not only in the country, but across the globe. As a result of movement restrictions that saw most non-essential services being closed down in January and February, ZSE firms said they had not been able to get audit firms to complete their work. “Issuers whose half-year and full-year financial period ended on 31 December 2020 and are due for publication by 31 March 2021 are hereby granted a 30-day compliance grace period to 30 April 2021,” the ZSE said. “Issuers who can meet the statutory deadlines, despite the foregoing are encouraged to comply as usual.” Ordinarily, the listed firms have three months within which to publish their financial results following the end of their financial period. – New Ziana.
