The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent HOUSE muso Bhadilah has earned himself an interview with South African radio station Makhado FM due to his online media presence. The interview will be broadcast on the Sumbandila breakfast show hosted by De Don’s3667 as from 9:10am on Friday. This will be the Beitbridge artiste’s first interview outside the country and he is over the moon. Bhadilah said he realised the power of social media after one of the host’s from the radio station saw his works on Facebook. “I got the interview through a guy who’s a host at Makhado FM saw some of my stuff on Facebook and was interested in my work. He then contacted me for the interview. I feel so blessed and honoured to be interviewed by one of South Africa’s radio stations as it will surely open more doors for me.” If borders are opened, the artiste said he will travel to South Africa for the interview. But if they are still closed, he will do the interview through telephone. Bhadilah who is popular for his Nkonela song said he is working on singles that he will release as the year progresses. – @mthabisi_mthire
