The Chronicle Melissa Mpofu, Showbiz Editor Comedians Madlela Skhobokhobo (real name Mothusi Bashimane Ndlovu) and Madam Boss/Dudzai (real name Tyra Chikocho) are working on a sitcom in South Africa that is under production. Although they were trying to keep a tight lid on what they were working on, the two who are in the neighbouring country, on Monday afternoon let fans in on their partnership. During a Facebook live where they were on set clad in costumes, Madam Boss who admitted that she has challenges keeping things private introduced her followers to Madlela. Prior to the live, the two had shared pictures together, confirming that they were working on something.  <img class="alignnone wp-image-535208 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/madlela-crew-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/madlela-crew.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/madlela-crew-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “We’re here in South Africa to do great things so you guys must watch out. We’re entertainers so expect to have good laughs. Support us please,” pleaded Madlela during the Facebook live. “There’s something that we’re cooking and soon, we’ll talk about it in depth.” Letting the cat out of the bag, one of the crew members, Becky said they are working on a sitcom adding that she was impressed by Madam Boss as she managed to translate a 32-paged script in English into Shona. “We’re on set guys cooking up something with these celebrities, Madlela, Felix a Zulu guy and Madam Boss. Tyra’s English on set has improved because she translated a 32-page script from English to Shona. “We’re going to share the pilot soon and it’s going to be lovely,” Becky said. <img class="wp-image-535200 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/madam-boss-and-madlela.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/madam-boss-and-madlela.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/madam-boss-and-madlela-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Madam Boss and Madlela A visibly excited Madam Boss then showed followers the set and the crew’s entourage. She went on to admit that shooting the sitcom was no walk in the park while holding her script. It was refreshing seeing the two popular comedians together as they took turns to speak each other’s languages and showed unity. Madam Boss from time to time, encouraged an otherwise shy Madlela to join her live, encouraging him to frequently use his social media pages to do live videos to keep in touch with fans. From the scenes on the live video, the two are being treated like royalty in the neighbouring country with the crew seemingly professional. The production therefore is fit to be top notch but only time will tell.
