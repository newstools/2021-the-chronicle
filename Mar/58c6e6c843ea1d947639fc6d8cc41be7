The Chronicle Judge Jarachara, Chronicle Reporter A Safeguard security reaction vehicle which was reportedly hijacked by armed robbers who pounced at a bureau de change in Bulawayo this morning has been found abandoned in Malindela suburb. Six armed robbers who were driving a honda fit vehicle without number plates pounced at Access Bureau de Change situated at Parkade Centre at the corner of Fife street and 9th Avenue and disarmed the security guard shortly after 8AM. They ordered everyone who was in the bureau de change to lie down. A safeguard team that reacted to the robbery was also disarmed and the security firm’s honda fit vehicle was highjacked and the armed robbers made off with an undisclosed amount of money in foreign currency. Police told Chronicle that the robbers dumbed the safeguard car in Malindela suburbs in Bulawayo and went away with their silver one without number plates. The latest robbery follows last week’s robberies when armed robbers raided two service stations in Bulawayo, tied attendants’ hands before getting away with cash in dramatic incidents that occurred within two days. @jdgjarachara
