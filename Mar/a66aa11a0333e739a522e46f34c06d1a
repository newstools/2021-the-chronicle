The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter VICTORIA FALLS is the second-best place to visit for holiday and leisure in the world, according to Geo Fernweh, a German travel inspiration magazine. Despite the disruptive effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has grounded the tourism industry on the back of international travel restrictions, the country’s prime resort has continued to attract interest of international holiday makers. The publication confirms that Germans and other nationalities would long to visit Zimbabwe among their top bucket list of destinations. This comes days after American Travel + Leisure magazine named Victoria Falls Safari Lodge one of the best in the world and among top five facilities in Africa. Players in the tourism industry are buoyed by the development saying it boosts confidence and speaks to the need to establish direct airlink with countries like Germany among others. Fernweh said Victoria Falls is a rare natural wonder, which any traveller would want to visit in their lifetime and ranked it second after Tanzania’s Spice Island on the coast in Zanzibar.
