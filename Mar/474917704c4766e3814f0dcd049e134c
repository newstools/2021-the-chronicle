JOURNALISTS in Bulawayo turned up in their numbers yesterday to take the jab under the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination programme being rolled out countrywide targeting frontline workers. There was also an overwhelming response from journalists from Zimpapers’ Bulawayo branch who got inoculated.
Zimbabwe is among the first African countries to vaccinate its citizens against Covid-19. <img class="alignnone wp-image-534459 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/vaccine.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/vaccine.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/vaccine-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The country recently received 200 000 Covid-19 vaccine doses from China with Vice-President Dr Constantino Chiwenga subsequently launching the national vaccination programme and being the first citizen to be vaccinated. The frontline workers being vaccinated include health workers, Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) officials, Customs and Immigration employees, journalists and members of the security sector. In interviews soon after inoculation, journalists could not hide their excitement as they urged citizens to participate in the programme under the next phases. Sunday News Assistant Editor Mkhululi Sibanda said as story tellers, it is important for journalists to tackle misinformation being peddled on social media about the vaccines through participating in the programme. “People should take this vaccination programme seriously because it is critical in arresting the spread of the deadly Covid-19. There is nothing to fear because it was scientifically proven that it is harmless hence, we should be reluctant to take the jab,” he said. “As storytellers, we should lead by example so that we instill confidence in our audience. By participating in this programme, we have also been able to challenge the myth around the vaccines.” Sunday News Features Editor Vincent Gono said despite speculation around Sinopharm vaccines, the media should play a critical role by counteracting misinformation. “The information around these vaccines is well articulated and hence there is no need for people to be afraid. This whole issue of speculation borders around misinformation, which the media can diffuse thus giving people the correct information about the vaccines and the benefits that come with inoculation,” he said. Sunday News Senior Reporter, Robin Muchetu, who is also a Covid-19 survivor, urged media practitioners to be at the forefront by participating in the vaccination programme. “Initially, I was scared to take the jab because of misconceptions and lies peddled on various social media platforms about the vaccines. However, after doing extensive research and seeing my colleagues getting it, it boosted my confidence and today (yesterday) I got vaccinated,” she said. “As a survivor of Covid-19, I did not want to take further risks,”
Chronicle Online reporter, Peter Matika said: “Safety is a top priority for everyone and therefore getting vaccinated has proved to be an effective way of protecting yourself from Covid-19 including people around you. As a frontline worker, being among the first to get vaccinated has shown just how important we are to the country and I urge everyone else to do the same.” Sunday News Sports Correspondent Ngqwele Dube said initially he was cynical about taking the vaccine due to falsehoods peddled on social media. “I later realised it was for my safety and those around me would benefit immensely from my taking the jab and I also got solace from the fact that vaccines have been taken in other countries including China with no life-threatening side effects reported,” he said. Sunday News Senior Reporter Vusumuzi Dube, who also got vaccinated, said as a frontline worker, he felt it was key for him to lead by example in light of miscommunication on social media. “At first, I was obviously reluctant, but after conducting some research and interacting with medical experts as well as seeing Vice President Chiwenga leading by example when he took the first jab, I felt it was also prudent for me to be part of the programme,” he said. “In addition to that, the actual process is done in a professional manner and those administering the jab are very helpful in terms of information dissemination before you take the jab. I am encouraging all Zimbabweans to take part in the vaccination programme and play their part in containing this pandemic.” Chronicle Online news editor Stanford Chiwanga said he got vaccinated because it was good for public health. “We all have a part to play in combating the pandemic. Forget the conspiracy theories and ignore the alarmists. Refusing to vaccinate compromises not only my health but public health.” Government has procured 600 000 more Sinopharm vaccine doses from China as it steps up efforts to inoculate 10 million citizens and an additional 1,2 million doses are on the way. The inoculation of citizens will enable the country to achieve 60 percent herd immunity.-@mashnets
