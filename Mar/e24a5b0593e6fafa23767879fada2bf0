The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau Beitbridge Municipality has with effect from Monday hiked water tariffs by 7 percent in a move set to cushion the local authority from challenges emanating from the Covid19 pandemic. In addition, the review is also expected to help the local authority narrow its debt with the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) and also boost its capacity to evenly supply the precious liquid to most properties around the town. The Municipality’s Finance Director Mr Anymore Mbedzi said they had to adjust the water tariffs after Zinwa increased the price of the supply of bulky water by 25 percent. “Zinwa increased water charges by 25 percent to a tariff of $119/m3 including VAT and as a result, we have adjusted our tariffs by an average of 7 percent. “You will note that prior to the latest development, the cost price of water supply in residential areas was heavily subsidized and it was no longer sustainable,” he said. Mr Mbedzi said under the new tariffs, those living in high-density who were paying currently paying $1,443 for 15/m3 will now have to part with $1795. He said rates in medium-density suburbs had been reviewed from an average consumption of 20m3 currently pegged at $2,777 to $2,928. With respect to the low-density areas, the residents will now pay $5,376 for 33/m3 up from currently and will be $5,259. “Commercial and industrial average 80m3 currently $19,580 and will be reduced to $17, 798,” said Mr Mbedzi. He said they were still collecting revenue below their targets, a development that is affecting service delivery. In January 2021 the municipality collected $5,458,933.97 and remitted $5,600,000 to ZINWA. He said as of December 31 last year the local authority was owed $119 million in rates and services. “Residential properties only, owe the municipality a total of $91,807,011 for water and rates, and our collection rate for water in January 2021 was 33 percent. “We urge residence and ratepayers to settle bills in time to ensure uninterrupted service delivery,” said Mr Mbedzi. He said those with non-functional water meters are advised to have them replaced so that they are billed for actual consumption, not through the estimate. “Our unit of measure for consumption is only a functional water meter,” added Mr Mbedzi. – @tupeyo
