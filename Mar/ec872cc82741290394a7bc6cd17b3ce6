The Chronicle GENEVA/ZURICH – The World Health Organisation’s director general said on Monday that systems meant to protect public health were working, as several countries suspended use of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine to investigate possible side-effects. “This does not necessarily mean these events are linked to Covid-19 vaccination, but it’s routine practice to investigate them, and it shows that the surveillance system works and that effective controls are in place,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a virtual media briefing. A WHO advisory committee planned to meet yesterday to discuss the vaccine, which Germany, France and Italy said on Monday they were pausing after several countries reported serious conditions in people who had received the shot. Denmark and Norway had stopped giving the shot last week after reporting isolated cases of blood clots, bleeding or a low platelet count. -IOL.
