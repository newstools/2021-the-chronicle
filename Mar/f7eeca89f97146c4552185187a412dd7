The Chronicle Prosper Ndlovu in Victoria Falls
PRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday received his first Covid-19 jab alongside Cabinet Ministers and 16 other political party leaders at the Victoria Falls Hospital where he also officially launched the second phase of the national mass vaccination programme. He called on all Zimbabweans to embrace the ongoing vaccination exercise, which is now being spread to cover more groups with a target herd immunity of 60 percent of the entire population. The bold step by the Head of State and Commander in Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces and his Cabinet gives solid confidence in the safety of the vaccines and demonstrates the Government’s commitment to ensuring public health safety, which is critical for national economic recovery. Yesterday’s national launch was historic not only in being held in the resort town of Victoria Falls, the country’s prime tourism destination, but also in the attendance of other political party leaders, who were also vaccinated. The other political leaders included MDC-T leader Mr Douglas Mwonzora, NCA party leader Lovemore Madhuku and Mr Kwanele Hlabangana of the Republican Party of Zimbabwe among others. Cabinet ministers that attended the launch and were also vaccinated were Dr Sithembiso Nyoni (women affairs), Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri (defence), Mangaliso Ndlovu (environment and tourism) and Owen Ncube (state security). Former Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa was also vaccinated. The intensified vaccination exercise is expected to pave way for the growth of unlimited tourism activities in the country, with Victoria Falls expected to take the lead. Following the successful roll out of the initial vaccination phase, which targeted frontline workers, President Mnangagwa’s Government has procured 1,2 million doses of vaccines from China whose initial consignment was received last Tuesday, with the remainder set for delivery early next month. China, Russia and India have also donated vaccines to complement Government efforts to save lives. The target groups now include teachers, the judiciary services, the clergy, the elderly and people with chronic conditions. <img class="alignnone wp-image-537995 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/ED-BP.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/ED-BP.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/ED-BP-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The efforts attest to the country’s resilience and the Government’s desire to guarantee a higher momentum economic journey towards an upper middle-income economy by 2030, said the President in his keynote address. He said the Second republic was driving at achieving an intricate balance between national public health Covid-19 aspirations and the opening up of the economy. “This balance and use of science should see us resume various activities across the entire economic spectrum,” he said. “We should, therefore, stand ready and prepare to harness huge prospects for economic growth in agriculture, mining, energy, manufacturing and the construction sector, among others. “No one is safe until everyone is safe. I therefore, challenge all of us in our respective communities to accept the vaccination programme and to shun vaccine hesitancy, misinformation and negative conspiracy theories. “Getting vaccinated is a personal and family responsibility as well as a national obligation.” President Mnangagwa said the first national Covid-19 vaccination exercise was successful as it recorded broad acceptance of above 68 percent of the targeted groups. Already the Covid-19 national infection rate is declining while the recovery rate stands at 90 percent, said the President. He commended the frontline workers and the security services sector for their fortitude and dedication to duty despite Covid-19 risks but warned against complacency, insisting that the nation must remain vigilant and maintain high compliance to set World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and protocols, including lockdown measures. <img class="alignnone wp-image-537986 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/ED-gets-jab.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/ED-gets-jab.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/ED-gets-jab-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Your unflinching service and patriotism to your country and people has seen you emerge as true heroes during these distressing times. Well done to you all,” said President Mnangagwa. He said the phase two national vaccination programme would remain state funded, free and voluntary. The President paid particular tribute to both local and international stakeholders for the unwavering support rendered to the Government as the country fights the spread of the deadly pandemic. Zimbabwe has 1 512 confirmed Covid-19 deaths and has recorded 36 665 positive cases to date while globally more than two million people have died and more than 122 million others are infected. Fighting an invisible enemy like Covid-19 calls for unity, said President Mnangagwa as he stressed the need for singleness of purpose among citizens. He said going forward there is need for people to live in harmony and have a shared vision towards their developmental destiny. Turning to fellow political leaders he said: “It’s incumbent upon us to galvanise the people to always act in the national interest and to be productive, honest and hard-working for the prosperity of our great country. “In our diversity and different persuasions, we are one people, with one motherland, Zimbabwe.” President Mnangagwa challenged players in the tourism and hospitality sector to play their part and position the country for growth post-Covid-19 era. He also pledged to continue facilitating an enabling environment for a thriving private sector and urged industry leaders to join the vaccination crusade.  President Mnangagwa once again reminded those that intend to privately procure vaccines that the vaccines should be availed to beneficiaries at no cost. He said collective efforts were critical in achieving increased production and transforming ordinary people’s lives through sustainable empowerment interventions. Vice President Dr Constantine Chiwenga, who is also Minister of Health and Child Care and has been on the ground since Tuesday, received President Mnangagwa. VP Chiwenga had earlier conducted a tour of several onsite and mobile vaccination centres in the resort town. He was accompanied by Matabeleland North Minister of Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Cde Richard Moyo, who said the mass vaccination launch was befitting for Victoria Falls, as it will give required confidence to tourists that Zimbabwe is a safe destination. Several senior Government officials and business leaders attended the event.
