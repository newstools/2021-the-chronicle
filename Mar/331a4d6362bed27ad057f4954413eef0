The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Noreen Moyo, a 23-year-old final year Journalism and Media Studies student at the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) is a very determined person. After failing to land a spot as a presenter on KeYona TV, Moyo did the unthinkable by resurfacing as a content producer on the same platform. She submitted a production titled Thekwane that she was working on and it was given the green light. She went on to clinch a partnership between Sky Media and Amakhosi Studios and the soapie will be exclusively for KeYona TV. The production will be set in Plumtree, Bulilima, Tsholotsho and Botswana with a call for cast members underway. Chronicle Showbiz caught up with Moyo to find out more about her. <img class="wp-image-535444 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/no2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/no2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/no2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Noreen Moyo “I’m the fifth born girl in a family of seven and an undergraduate final year student at Nust. Born and raised in a rough terrain, I learnt life in a hard way, something which made me strong, principled and a visionary woman. “The struggles that my mother faced also gave me the zeal to empower myself no matter what,” she said. This upbringing likely explains why Moyo was not deterred when she did not get the role as a presenter. “I’m a woman who’s not limited by the surrounding circumstances. For example, despite my height, I once contested for Miss Nust. I’m also very passionate about film and video production and directing as well as acting,” said Moyo. She said her vision is to nurture her passion of filmmaking and directing as well as demonstrating her mind through action. – @mthabisi_mthire
