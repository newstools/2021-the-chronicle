The Chronicle Portugal will dispatch soldiers in the first half of April to Mozambique where they will train local troops following an attack by Islamist insurgents on the town of Palma, Lusa news agency said yesterday, citing a defence ministry source. The Portuguese news agency said a bilateral agreement calling for a total of 60 special forces troops to Mozambique was being finalised. Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva also told the state TV channel RTP late Monday that a team of “around 60” soldiers were “getting ready” to be sent to Portugal’s former colony “in the coming weeks”. The team would “support the Mozambican army in training special forces,” he said. In a dramatic escalation of an insurgency launched in 2017, jihadists last Wednesday attacked the northern town of Palma, located just 10 kilometres (six miles) from the site of a planned multi-billion-dollar gas project. On Monday, the IS group claimed it conducted the three-day raid against military and government targets and said it had seized control of the town. The Mozambican government has said dozens of people died in the raid, but the exact toll in the remote northern town was not known. Palma was almost completely deserted on Monday following the deadly raid, which forced its residents to flee by road, boat or on foot. It was the biggest and closest raid to a multi-billion-dollar gas project being built on a peninsula just 10 kilometres (six miles) away, by France’s Total and other energy giants.-AFP.
