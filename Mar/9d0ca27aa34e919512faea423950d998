The Chronicle Chronicle Reporter AS the world is slowly getting accustomed to the new normal, where global citizens are embracing a new way of life under the novel coronavirus pandemic, businesses are seeking to rise again. In the past year, since the world was devastated by the Covid – 19 pandemic businesses suffered a major blow and set global economies astray. However, a ray of hope shinned across the world, since world scientists began developing vaccines against the virus. In that light, since Zimbabwe received its first batch of the Sinopharm vaccine donated by China, business has begun rebuilding. With many local businesses having suffered a blow from the pandemic, some indigenous business people and like-minded people have resorted to seeking divine intervention in ‘unlocking their wealth’… and who better to turn to but prophets and clergymen. <img class="size-full wp-image-532729" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/ggg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/ggg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/ggg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Black Elisha “In the Bible, many people were identified by the nature of their occupation, and their business was acknowledged. God is interested in our whole lives, and this includes our vocations and businesses. When we have a Kingdom perspective, our focus on the activity of the Holy Spirit will not be solely confined to church meetings, or to Christian groups and organisations. We will follow God’s and Jesus’ footsteps—into the world,” said Black Elisha, adding that since the country began fighting the pandemic many business people have sought spiritual services to boost their companies. “In the Bible, we see God intimately involved in the lifestyle, business and property of those who followed Him. We see God actively at work in businesses and the marketplace. I have been hard at work through the glory of God, in assisting business to be revived. As you know my prowess is within the spiritual padlock and that is what I use to unlock the potential and superiority of business,” said Black Elisha. He then explained the role and purpose of prophets in business: “A prophet’s primary responsibility is to equip believers to become spiritually mature, to restore families and to closely support apostolic Kingdom builders. It is through prophetic declarations; prophets set leaders in their God-given position and release an anointing over them that enables them to change the course of history.  Prophets protect nations and give advance notice of natural disasters. They deliver warnings of personal sin and foretell the effect of that sin on the erring person and on the people, they lead. Prophets direct world leaders through the interpretation of dreams, prophetic insight and divine wisdom. And like wise it is also possible in business, that is why it is important to have a business driven and inspired by God,” said Black Elisha. He said the Old Testament is filled with accounts of kings, government officials and heads of businesses that surrounded themselves with priests and prophets to enquire of the Lord and to receive divine guidance before promoting leaders, concluding transactions or entering into conflict. “When the counsel of the prophets was followed, the people prospered and the nation was blessed. Today, there is a great need for prophets to come alongside apostolic leaders and visionaries to help them see God’s blueprint for their lives and businesses more clearly in order to avoid pitfalls and unnecessary detours,” said Black Elisha.
