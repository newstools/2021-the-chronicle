The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter CHEVERONS captain Sean Williams hopes his side will build on their brilliant performance against Afghanistan that saw them cruising to a 10-wicket win inside two days in the first of two Tests in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. Williams smashed 105 to guide Zimbabwe to 250 all out in the first innings and establish a lead of 119 runs after they had dismissed the Afghans for 131 in the first innings. Some tight bowling saw Zimbabwe bowling out their hosts for 135 in the second innings, leaving the Chevrons needing just 17 runs to clinch the Test, which they knocked for no loss. “I am hoping for more of the same from the boys and the other players as well. A performance like this from a team in both bowling and batting unit shows everyone did well. What you will find out now is everyone will start stepping up and that is what l am after; a team unit performance. If the team clicks and all players are firing then Zimbabwe will become dangerous,” said Williams. “It’s important that we stay humble, there is another Test match to go. We have to enjoy for the next day or so and get back to it. It’s pressure; when you’ve got that many debutants (Afghanistan had three while Zimbabwe had one) and you lose quick wickets, it’s pressure,” he said. He said Test cricket is a huge mental battle and Afghanistan is a very strong white-ball team. “There are certain disciplines in Test cricket that you can get away with not having in ODI cricket because the slip cordon is not there. So, it’s a mental battle. It’s almost like a war going on in your mind when you’re out there. Once you learn to go and control that, you will be ready for Test cricket.” The second Test is scheduled for March 10-14 at the same venue. – @innocentskizoe
