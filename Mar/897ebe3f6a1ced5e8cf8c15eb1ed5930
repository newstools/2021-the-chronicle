Gwanda residents have been without water for four days following bursts of asbestos cement (AC) pipes that supply three quarters of the town. Two major pipe bursts were identified on the main supply line to the town. The hardest hit are those residing in high lying areas like Senondo 50, Spitzkop and Phakama and those in low lying areas among them Jahunda, Marriage and Geneva western suburbs. By the time of going to print last night, water had not reached high lying areas who last had running water on their taps on Friday night. Gwanda Municipality Engineer Ndabezinhle Twala yesterday afternoon said works are underway to rectify the issue with low lying areas expected to receive water before day end yesterday. He said the town’s water system is in shambles. “The system is old where we are using the AC pipes that are now outdated. “We, however, are hands on in addressing the water challenges. If there are no further pipe bursts, every suburb should have tap water by Thursday,” said Eng Twala. He said the rainy season had affected the local authority’s ability to avail water to residents. “The rainy season offers variations on soils where some soils become extremely weak. “When pressure is exerted on the soil it also goes on to cause pipe bursts,” he said. Eng Twala said the local authority is taking measures to address water shortages in future by having back up plans. “We also will be installing two 10 000 litre tanks at Ultra High suburb and Spitzkop suburb by the end of April. “These will be back up plans for our supply of water to the aforementioned areas and in future we hope to extend it to every suburb,” said Eng Twala.-@mthabisi_mthire.
