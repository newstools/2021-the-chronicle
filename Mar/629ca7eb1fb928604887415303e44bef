Gospel musician Rose Mambo has encouraged people to look up to God for help with her new track Ezintabeni, which is derived from the Bible book of Psalms. The gospel house track produced by DJ Tamuka, was released last week on all digital platforms and the music video directed by Umsebenzi kaBlaqs was premièred on her YouTube page. Rose Mambo was born in Bulawayo and has three albums to her name and has worked with the late Sam Mtukudzi, Alexio Kawara, Mathias Mhere and Shingisai Suluma since breaking into the industry in 2003. She said Ezintabeni was a song of hope and encouragement. “The song is titled Ezintabeni and it’s derived from Psalm 121 which encourages us to look up to God because he is our source of help. Ezintabeni is therefore a song of hope and encouragement to say no matter what we go through, God is always there to help in times of need,” said Rose Mambo. She said the Covid-19 lockdown was a blessing in disguise as she managed to write more songs. “I came up with this song during the lockddown and it’s meant to encourage people to look up to God for help during difficulties such as what we were facing as a result of Covid-19,” said Rose Mambo. The mother of two, Rose Mambo attended Lukhanyiso Primary School, Mpopoma High, Wanezi Mission and Inyathi High School.
