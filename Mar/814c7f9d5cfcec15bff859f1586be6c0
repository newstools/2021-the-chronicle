HIGHLANDERS have parted ways with their legal representatives Ncube and Partners Law Firm over what is believed to be differences in legal opinion. The board allegedly disregarded legal opinion on the extension of the term of office of three executive committee members who had served their three-year term following postponement of the annual general meeting after the club was refused clearance by authorities to gather for an AGM to pave way for elections. The lawyers said the club’s constitution was explicit and any extention would be in violation of Article 10.3 which states that elected executive committee members shall hold office for a period of three years after which they automatically lose their positions. They also said they were never consulted by the club on its decision to venture into mining yet some of the contractual engagements under this venture needed legal scrutiny. According to the lawyers, they were also not consulted over the three-year US$300 000 kit sponsorship deal with British sportswear firm OTB. At Sunday’s AGM held at the club house, life member Thembinkosi Thwala, who is part of incumbent chairman Kenneth Mhlophe’s campaign team, called for the removal of Ncube and Partners as the club’s lawyers. The proposal was seconded and carried as there was no counter proposal. The incoming executive set to take office after elections this Sunday has to appoint new legal representatives.
