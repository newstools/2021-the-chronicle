The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent TWENTY-NINE schools in Gokwe received a major boost after they received Covid-19 hygiene kits to help curb the spread of the virus. 18 schools in Gokwe South and 11 from Gokwe North received water purification tablets, hand washing facilities, water buckets, soap, hand sanitizers, protective clothing, chlorine solution, reusable masks among others from the Farm Community Trust of Zimbabwe (FCTZ). Receiving the donation, Midlands Provincial Education Director, Mr Jameson Machimbira said the donation came at the right time when schools were preparing to resume lessons next week. “A school can only open provided it is safe for learners, teachers and the community at large. Otherwise, if not safe, the school remains closed as we do not want to risk lives not only for students but those of teachers, parents and the community at large. This donation therefore will go a long way in ensuring schools are ready for reopening,” said Mr. Machimbira. “Portable water remains a challenge in most Gokwe schools as in some instances schools have to buy water from private suppliers. I am therefore glad that FCTZ is also facilitating the repair of 52 broken down water points in Gokwe South as water is key in the fight against covid-19 more so to learning institutions.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-535455 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/20210305_131853.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/20210305_131853.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/20210305_131853-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He urged school authorities to pay attention to issues of disability and challenges that the girl child faces. “If you want to check how sensitive our institutions are to issues of disability, check the toilets and water points which do not allow them to access basic facilities. We need to continue thinking about this special group of people together as a community as well as those of the girl child,” he said. He said water is critical to the girl child. “Menstrual hygiene is a natural happening and must be attended to by every member of society including schools. Toilets must have facilities that allow girls to look at themselves to boost their confidence,” he said. FCTZ Executive Director, Mr. Godfrey Magaramombe said the donation is part of their project to improve facilities in schools and in communities across the country. “The donation is part of a Covid-19 response project operational in Gokwe and Mudzi district in Mashonaland East province. The project endeavors to mainstream gender-based violence, disability and prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse,” said Mr Magaramombe.
