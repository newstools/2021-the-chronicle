The inaugural awards which will be hosted by Ammara Brown seek to honour and recognise living legendary creatives who have raised the country’s flag high over the past 40 years. They will be held virtually under the theme “Our Legacy, Our Pride”. With an array of performances from local and diaspora-based artistes, organisers have advised locals to tune in as it is going to be a memorable event. <img class="wp-image-502932 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Mzoe-7.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Mzoe-7.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/Mzoe-7-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mzoe 7 Award ceremonies that have been held virtually over the past year have been marred by technical glitches but Nama executive director, Napoleon “Napster” Nyanhi says they have done all they can to guard against possible glitches.

We really cast our net far and wide (for the collaboration) and those that answered the call are the ones you’ll see. “We also tried to ensure we had all continents represented, but however, we couldn’t have representatives from South America and Asia on time,” he said. Napster said the collaborative track is meant bring Zimbabweans together. He said after the performance tonight, the track will be uploaded on YouTube. — @mthabisi_mthir
