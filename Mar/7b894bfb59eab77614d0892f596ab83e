Afro-pop band Ngoma Ingoma has featured on Winky Ds song titled Jabula/Daira Ndikunzwe that also features Gemma Griffiths in a move which they feel will open more doors for their brand. The Afro-beat song that was recorded last year was released last week. It has been playing on various radio stations around the country. With a touch of dancehall, the song is in IsiNdebele, ChiShona and English with Winky D having sung some of the verses alongside Gemma. Ngoma Ingoma laid lyrics to the chorus. Ngoma Ingoma spokesperson Blessing “Stot” Sitotombe said working with Gemma and Winky D was a learning curve. “It was a good thing working with Winky D and Gemma as it showed that we’re getting national recognition. They wanted a group that would represent this side of the country and they chose us which was quite humbling,” said Stot. He said this was the perfect time for them to tap into another market. “As Ngoma Ingoma, we have a second album in the pipeline which is almost complete. So, I think the timing (of release) is going to be perfect for us to tap into a new market,” said Stot. Ngoma Ingoma is a seven-piece award-winning Afro-pop group that is famous for the song Amalobolo off their debut album. The group is comprised of Stot (bass guitarist and vocals), Tiyelani Chauke (keyboard and vocals), Samuel Siwela (lead guitarist and lead vocals), Obey Mudiwa (drummer), Prince Joel Nyoni (auxiliary keyboards and vocals), Carlos Jiri (percussion and lead vocals) and De Lukes (mbira and lead vocals). With inspiration from Oliver Mtukudzi, Chiwoniso Maraire, Andy Brown and Bhundu Boys, the group is mainly focused on the Afrocentric sound with strong influence from local music styles such as mbira, Chimurenga, African Pop styles, Tribal House and Jit.
