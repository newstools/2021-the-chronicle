AMBITIOUS Ponel Youth Soccer Academy (PYSA) has engaged the Hwange Rural District Council seeking land to build a football village that will benefit budding talent in Matabeleland North. The academy based in Dete aims is to promote, teach and develop football within the Dete community as well as provide quality programmes at the lowest possible cost. PYSA president Nelson Ndeka says he fully appreciates how big their dream is and the amount of work required to make the project a success. “We recently submitted an application to to the Hwange Rural District Council for a piece of land on which we intend to build a soccer village. If the application succeeds then we will be faced with a gigantic task to build a first class soccer complex in similar to Naturena Village of Kaizer Chiefs in South Africa,” said Ndeka. “It’s a big and demanding which needs hard work and serious partnerships with the corporate world,” he said.
The academy already has merchandise such as branded face masks and golf t-shirts on sale. On Monday, the academy launched its website to help market its brand. “The website is an interactive and informative platform where PYSA is now able to advertise online, inform, provide awareness and promote our products. Our online presence will help us expand our market,” said Ndeka. – @innocentskizoe
