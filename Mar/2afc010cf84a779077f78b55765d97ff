She said voting will only be for the public choice award. “Preparations for the pageant are going on well and we’re excited that we’ve managed to secure various sponsors. We’ll have about three judges who’ll closely watch the models as they catwalk the ramp. “Other than modelling, our vision is to have the contestants giving back to community,” Minister Signet said. She said if this pageant goes according to plan, they will expand it to other provinces and countries. Afro-pop musician, Sotsha Fire (real name Otnel Sangweni) who hails from Gwanda said he decided to try out modelling as part of ways to be more versatile. “I’ve decided to give it a try and I’m looking forward to taking to the ramp. Just like I expanded and ventured into acting, I want to see how this modelling thing will go,” said an excited Sotsha Fire. “I’m happy that I’m already getting support from my fans as I’m currently leading the votes on the males side for the public award. This is really exciting and I can’t wait for the pageant.” – @mthabisi_mthire
