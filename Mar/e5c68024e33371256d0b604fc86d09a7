THE country’s hip-hop fraternity has united to produce an album titled The Vaccine which encourages members of the public to be vaccinated against Covid-19. The 10-track offing which is yet to be released features more than 30 artistes drawn from the different provinces. From Bulawayo, a track titled The Vaccine that features GTL, uSmokey Joint, YAMATO, Cruza Hemzy, iiSSy Molly, Kuly and Phana was produced while Matabeleland South came up with the track Get off my Way (G.O.M.W) that features T Ron Sparta, Jori Mahlang, Jae Parblo and Lil Tash. Matabeleland North artistes produced the track Kubuhlungu featuring Snowie, NMC, Pablo7, Obviedoh, Maskaal, Carkey, DJ Snappy, and Klater. The track Set Us Free (Ichapera rinhi) was produced by Harare artistes that include legendary Maskiri, Tyno Chormzy, Mill Kays, Lecturerzw and Tmac. Masvingo produced the track Mask Up featuring Stizzie and NT Mixe and Midlands contributed the track titled Stuck At Home featuring Nino, Candy Cane and 138. Sebastian Black from one of the corporates behind the project, said The Vaccine album will be released soon after it is presented to the arts ministry. He said the album’s main purpose is to encourage members of the public to be vaccinated against Covid-19. “The album is not yet out although it’s complete. We’re now in the process of taking it to the Ministry of Youths, Sports, Arts and Recreation and the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe for their consideration. “Through the album, we tried to incorporate various artistes in order to make it all encompassing,” said Black. He said the album served as a unifier for hip-hop artistes, something he said should be spread to communities in the fight against the pandemic. Black said working on the project had its own challenges as some artistes, especially the established ones were not forthcoming. — @mthabisi_mthire.
