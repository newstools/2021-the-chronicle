THE family of a teacher who was killed in Silobela last week, has demanded 30 head of cattle from the perpetrator’s family as compensation and part of an out-of-court settlement. Mtandazo Moyo (52), of Simana Village under Chief Malisa, who taught at Simana Primary School was found hanging from a tree in the early hours of February 27, a day after he had a misunderstanding with a fellow villager. Moyo was allegedly killed by Thobelani Bhebhe in a misunderstanding involving a woman who is believed to be the latter’s ex-wife. The Moyo family has since demanded that the Bhebhe family part with 30 beasts plus US$3 000 dollars. The Bhebhe family managed to release five cattle but the Moyos refused to accept them and dumped the body at the Bhebhe homestead demanding full payment. It took Silobela legislator Mthokozisi Manoki-Mpofu and Chief Malisa’s intervention for the Moyo family to accept the five cattle and bury their son. Cde Manoki-Mpofu confirmed that burial was conducted on Sunday. “It is true that the Moyo family had dumped the body at the Bhebhe homestead as they demanded that they be paid 30 cattle and money. I had to intervene together with Chief Malisa as the body was now at an advanced stage of decomposition. Fortunately, they understood and burial was conducted and we are now negotiating to see how Bhebhe can now pay the remaining beasts and the remaining money,” said Cde Manoki-Mpofu. He together with Chief Malisa were negotiating with the Moyo family so that there would be a payment plan. “I understand the Moyos have reduced the number from 30 to 15 plus money on top. We are now trying to see how best the Bhebhes can come up with a payment plan. We are on the issue together with Chief Malisa,” he said.
