The Chronicle By Lovemore Dube
THE history of Highlanders FC would be incomplete without mention of generations of junior development squads that held fans spellbound with immaculate performances. While others fell by the wayside as is the norm that not the whole squad gets promoted to the first team, when they were a unit they promised so much. Junior squads that come to mind are the 1964-66 guys; the late Barry Daka, Billy Sibanda, Ananias Dube and Lawrence Phiri, the generation of George Moyo, Smart Moyo and Jabulani Mbambo, whose majority left for Botswana to join the liberation struggle. Immediately after there was the Madinda Ndlovu, Nhamo Shambira, Themba Lunga and Phana Mthimkhulu gang in 1979 to 1980 followed by what many believe could be the best ever juniors assembled by Albert ‘Ali’ Dube nicknamed after the English League defending champions Liverpool in 1982. Other notable groups were the 1987 stars who went to Aberdeen, the immediate group that gave the world Adam Ndlovu, Peter, Sturu Mushekwa, Nqobani Ncube, Benjamin Nkonjera, Musawenkosi Masango, Likhile Sithole, Nhlanhla Sithole and Isaac ‘The Dutchmaster’ Riyano. One cannot ignore Simba Rusike, Thabano Moyo, Methembe Ndlovu, Gift Lunga (Snr) and Wayne Albertyn, there were hotshots as did other groups that had Tawanda Chitapa, Noel Kaseke, Noel Cele, Bekithemba Nkiwane, Honour Gombami, Brighton Choto, Kelvin Moyo, Kuda Mahachi, Marvellous Nakamba, Elvis Moyo and Prince Dube. Chronicle Sport in its second instalment of Bosso@95 speaks to one of the key players of the Liverpool Under-18s Babsy Ncube (BN). He is the father of former Bosso winger Graham and cricketer Cunningham. His father Misheck played for Highlanders FC in the youthful days of Edward Dzowa. Chronicle Sport: Who were the characters in the side nicknamed Liverpool? BN: Talking about that team, it is one of the best talked about junior teams ever assembled at the club. I will start from the goalkeeper and mention everyone who was there when the team got that monicker. We had Francis Muringayi in goal, with Sam Sibanda at right back, then later Abrahama Senda came with another good player who was lanky whom we called Guy, at leftback there was Netsai Moyo. Willard Khumalo and Godfrey Paradza who had joined from Zimbabwe Saints played at the centre and at times there was Lawrence Ngcebetsha. In front of the centrebacks we had Summer Ncube and on the right wing, I competed with Saul Gomani Ndlovu and Harold Tshabalala whom we called Mthembo during those days. On position eight Patson Phiri and Abbie Senda used to compete while at centre striker I also competed with Oliver Ncube. Abbie Senda and Bongani Xaba filled the other centre striker position with Hagai Moyo a brother to Netsai and myself filling the left wing slot. CB Mahlangu was the substitute goalkeeper of the original Liverpool side. <img class="wp-image-534961 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Babsy-with-Liverpool.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Babsy-with-Liverpool.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Babsy-with-Liverpool-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Highlanders junior squad of 1982 nicknamed Liverpool: (Back row) Godfrey Paradza, Guy, Sam Sibanda, Francis Muringai, Hagai Moyo, CB Mahlangu, Summer Ncube, Abraham Senda (Front row) Babsy Ncube, Oliver Ncube, Saul Gomani Ndlovu, Netsai Moyo. Chronicle Sport: How did the Liverpool name come by? BN: We earned that monicker in 1982 after going the whole season without dropping a single point winning silverware along the way. Liverpool were at their best back then and their performances were captivating and fans saw us as something close to the great team of the time. We were no match for our peers and would play against guys far much older than us like Red Seal Rovers and beat them. In actual fact they were also scared of playing against us as we used to humiliate them. Chronicle Sport: Most memorable match as Liverpool! BN: We were at Rufaro Stadium and at half time we trailed 2-0 against Mhangura. We came back from the break breathing fire with Oliver scoring a rocket of a header from outside the box as we went on to overhaul the halftime deficit to a handy 4-2 win. We played the most fascinating football of our journey as a team as we clawed back into contention and eventually winning the Under-16 Castle Cup final against a Mhangura side that appeared to have used over aged players. Some of their players were just too big and good like the left footer and the goalkeeper who appeared to occupy every inch of the goalmouth with his huge size. Chronicle Sport: So much is said about the quality you were, you appeared to have a telepathic understanding of each other meaning you may have been together for a while, how long had you been as a unit? BN: The bulk of us started as Under-12s around 1977 and 1978. We were together at the youth clubs and primary schools through secondary schools days. Players were drawn from Mzilikazi Youth Centre, Thabiso, YCC with Senda coming from Tshabalala. Chronicle Sport: We hear of netball scorelines and that Oliver Ncube scored 143 goals that season, what was the opposition like? BN: It was meaningful when you look at Zimbabwe Saints boasting of John Sibanda, Farai Moyo and Garikayi Rwodzi, Joshua Mhizha at Red Seal Rovers, Bully Mckop and Cosmas Pritchard at Cosmos and George Ayibu at Rex and Eagles had its own great stars. Chronicle Sport: When was the project dismantled and why? We never got to hear or see some of the players in the Super League with the first team. BN: When Bobby Clark came, he was impressed with what was at his disposal. He literally wanted the whole of the 1982 team who were now Under-18s in 1983 promoted. He must have been told off about promoting a whole bunch of rookies into the first team in a season the club struggled. Summer Ncube, Netsai and Willard were promoted into the first team, as we also played for jobs from companies that had football clubs, Oliver went to Red Seal, Sam Sibanda and Saul went to Ingwebu, Abraham Sebda to Zisco and Paradza returned to Zimbabwe Saints where he was assured first team football. Summer played a few first team games and soon left for Botswana. We all went different ways enticed with jobs but we had a good team too coming behind us Lovejoy Mugadza from Zimbabwe Saints, Mpumelelo Dzowa, Ronnie Jowa, Sydney Zimunya and Mercedes Sibanda. Chronicle Sport: How did you feel about seeing the club disintegrate? BN: There is nothing I could do. I was taken by Gold Star a team owned by Sugar Refineries and played Division One football and later moved to play for Turnall where I became team manager, secretary and chairman.
I feel we deserved to go to the first team as a block. We gelled well and had this camaraderie born out of years playing together. Chronicle Sport: In your own honest view as a football loving person, were you quality or you happened to face weak opposition? BN: I have no doubt a majority if not the whole group would have played abroad. We were just too good. Chronicle Sport: What drove you to perform so well? BN: We came from far together. Ali knew how to get the best out of us. We had some great understanding because we played at school and even outside Highlanders as a group so we knew each other well as players. Ali used to take the first six of the Under-16s and give them Under-14 wingers, midfielders and strikers and vice versa to play against each other. By the time the junior age group got a player to move up, it was simple knitting together the jigsaw puzzle and fitting in well. That is why any of Mercedes Sibanda and other younger guys were able to gel with us. Following immediately behind us were Dzowa, Jowa, Chris Ncube, John Maseko and Thamsanqa Ndlovu. Chronicle Sport: Where else lay the trick? BN: You see I was with Mpumelelo and Thando at Lozikeyi, Willard Khumalo and Dumisani Ngulube at Mzilikazi Primary School and Summer Ncube at Lobengula. We played at the clubs, so we knew each other very well and we were friends and brothers on and off the field. Some even up to today still meet though sadly a number have passed on. Chronicle Sport: So when and where were you born? BN: I was born in Bulawayo on 1 July 1965 and attended Grade One to Form 4 in the city. Chronicle Sport: When did you retire from playing the game? BN: I broke a leg and retired in 1994 to take up administration. Chronicle Sport: About junior development…… BN: It is now demanding producing stars today. The costs are too high at a time when there is no industry unlike in the past where it was plentiful but with fewer incentives for the boys. Today they have scholarships and professional playing opportunities abroad. Thina (we) if you made it to the first team, you were the lucky one, getting a job was what we all hoped for. Sadly opportunities flashed for generations after us. Chronicle Sport: Thank you Ncube for your time. BN: You are welcome.
