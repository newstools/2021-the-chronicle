ONLY people that became Highlanders’ members before March 28, 2020, will be allowed to cast their vote at the club’s election on Sunday, secretary of the nomination court Cosmos Sikhosana has said. In a brief statement released yesterday, Sikhosana, who is also the Highlanders board of directors’ vice-chairman, said it had came to the club’s attention that there has been a huge influx of people visiting the club offices to renew their membership. “It has come to the attention of the nomination court that there has been an influx of people visiting the club’s offices to renew membership. It should be noted that the members who qualify to vote on Sunday 28th March 2021 are those that fulfil the following constitutional requirements: “Article 10.4: At such election, each member shall be entitled to only one vote in respect of each contested position, voting shall be by secret ballot and in the event of a tie, the returning officer shall have a casting vote and only those who have held valid membership cards for at least 12 months immediately before the ballot shall be eligible to attend and vote at all general meetings,” reads Sikhosana’s statement.
According to article 5.7 of the Highlanders constitution, a subscribing member who fails to pay his annual subscription by January 31 of each year shall automatically lose his or her membership. <img class="wp-image-537974 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Cosmos-Sikhosana.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Cosmos-Sikhosana.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Cosmos-Sikhosana-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cosmos Sikhosana Sikhosana said only members whose membership did not lapse and was continuous qualify to vote. Highlanders members were initially set to hold elections to choose club chairman, secretary and committee member on February 7, but the event was pushed back together with the annual general meeting, which was set for January 31, after the club failed to get clearance from authorities as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Tomorrow members will choose between incumbent chairman Kenneth Mhlophe and challenger Johnfat Sibanda for the chairmanship, while for the secretary’s position they will choose between incumbent Israel Moyo and Morgan “Gazza” Dube, with Mgcini Mafu and Bheka Sibanda vying for the committee member’s post.
