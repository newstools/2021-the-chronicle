The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent Beautiful murals are being painted in Bulawayo’s CBD as part of Hanzvadzi/Umnawami Mural Project to educate young girls about sex education. Hanzvadzi Umnawami (#GirlPowerZW) is a nationwide mural project by CaliGraph in collaboration with Culture Fund, European Union and Nash Paints.

These conversations were on the role that parents, older brothers and sisters play in educating young girls about sex and how the education is delivered at home,” read the statement. “From what we gathered and what we experienced growing up, sex education is a taboo topic in the home setup and it’s often left to be taught at school, or from experience – which is often dangerous.”
