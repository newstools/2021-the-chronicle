The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent After realising that a number of artistes in the country were struggling with medical bills when they fall ill, comedian MaForty was pained and negotiated a deal with a medical aid company where artistes from Matabeleland were set to receive discounted medical services. However, he has been left disheartened after the realisation that not many took up his offer as only four artistes have registered so far. MaForty said his initiative is growing as a laboratory and a pharmacy have jumped on board to offer their services and goods at an affordable price for artistes. “9th Avenue Surgery rolled out a medical facility for artistes in Bulawayo to get consultation at 50% and when it comes to drips, injections and dressing it will be retail cost prices. Now, there’s a lab on board which will offer 25% on all Hematology (blood), urology (urine) and body chemistry tests. “Procare Lab in Bulawayo will offer 25% on all tests while Vitamind Pharmacy will supply the injections at discounted prices just for artistes,” said MaForty. “But, unfortunately because of low uptake of the facility, the numbers are not encouraging these players to offer discounts on dispensary medication but we hope, eventually they will,” added MaForty. Procare Clinical laboratory marketing and administration officer Wendy John Chapfuwa said: “The driving force behind this idea is to make health care in such trying times available and accessible to all parties of society. “Entertainment plays a huge role in our daily lives and by driving this initiative, we’re talking our first step in supporting artistes as they prepare to go back to the new normal.” – @mthabisi_mthire
