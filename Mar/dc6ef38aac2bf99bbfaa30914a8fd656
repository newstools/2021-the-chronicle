Quick service restaurant (QSR) provider, Simbisa Brands Limited, is upbeat about maintaining a growth trajectory in the future after profit for the half-year to December 31, 2020 almost doubled despite the negative effects of Covid-19 in most economies it operates. Figures from the group show that profit for the period jumped 90 percent to $850 million compared to same period in the prior year. Chairman Addington Chinake, indicated the group is well placed for a good performance going forward despite the uncertainties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The growth will be anchored on, among others, its diversified store network and fast-growing delivery channels that work well during lockdown periods. “We therefore believe that we are well-positioned to navigate the challenges ahead successfully, due inter alia to our geographically diversified store network, strength of our take-away channel and fast-growing delivery and drive-thru channels. “We continue to make progress towards long-term growth and explore new possibilities for operational optimisation as we gear up to ease into a post-Covid-19 world, with a pipeline of 38 new stores for the remaining six months of the financial year,” said Mr Chinake in a statement accompanying the group financials.
