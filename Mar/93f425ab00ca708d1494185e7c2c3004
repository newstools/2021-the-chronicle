The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter TANZANIA-based Zimbabwean utility player Bruce Kangwa has extended his stay at Azam FC by a further 12 months. His contract was due to expire in five months’ time. The left-footed former Highlanders player joined the Tanzanian side in 2016 and has had more than 300 starts since then. Kangwa confirmed his contract extension to Chronicle Sport on Monday. “I’m happy and honoured to have been presented with another 12-month contract which will take me up to 2022. Azam has been my second home and I’m happy to continue serving them. I want to thank the club management and technical team who have shown faith in me by adding another year to my deal,” said Kangwa. The fringe national team winger’s strong performances since moving to Azam opened avenues for other Zimbabwean players. Azam is home to three other Zimbabweans, midfielder Never Tigere and striker Prince Dube as well as former national team fitness trainer Nyasha Charandura. FC Platinum striker Donald Ngoma, former Zim Leopards and Hwange forward Francesco Zekumbawire as well as ex-Young Warriors midfielder Tafadzwa Kutinyu once featured for Azam. – @ZililoR
