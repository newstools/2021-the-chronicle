OUSTED members of the Bulawayo Metropolitan Rugby Football Board (BMRFB) facilitated the cutting of overgrown grass at Hartsfield Grounds after about a year of complete neglect. They hired a tractor to mow the grass in the main and outside grounds following a run by Chronicle Sport last Friday highlighting the eyesore state of the facility. However, spokesperson for the ousted BMRFB board Farai Mudzekenyedzi said publication of the story by Chronicle Sport coincided with an earlier programme they had planned. He said they were not deterred by the Zimbabwe Rugby Union’s decision to replace them with an interim committee. “People should understand that as rugby loving people we will continue exercising our duties and maintaining Hartsfield Grounds for the good of the sport remains top priority. Please note that grass cut on Friday coincided with the day you published your story, as we had already hired a tractor for the work. We had to wait for a good time when the tractor could cut the grass without damaging the pitch due to the heavy rains,” said Mudzekenyedzi. “Also, recall that in October and November last year the state of Hartsfield Grounds was amazing and the grass only started growing when we received the good rains.” He revealed that they had also acquired line cutters and a lawn mower from South Africa. When they were ousted by ZRU last year, the interim BMRFB committee was tasked with auditing the board’s finances and restoring the facility. – @Zililo
