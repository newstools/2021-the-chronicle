The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Entrepreneur, Charity Sizani Tshuma who is based in South Africa is a woman on a mission to empower and educate fellow women through her beauty school, Mangako Health and Beauty Academy. Sizani who hails from Plumtree is training women on beauty courses that range from manicure and pedicure treatments to massage and facial skin care as she wants to empower them with knowledge and skills they can use to earn a living. Having started off as a domestic worker in the neighbouring country, Tshuma is now a successful entrepreneur who has had an opportunity to host successful spa events for big organisations like the ANC, Cosatu, Old Mutual and Ned Group. Because of her humble beginnings, she said her academy is driven by the mantra “It’s never too late to learn”. Speaking from her base in South Africa, Mamaz as Tshuma is affectionately known said her mission is to give young women, especially those from marginalised groups, a second chance at education and real opportunities to compete in business. “Through our academy, we empower a lot of Zimbabweans, South Africans and Malawians, most who work as domestic workers or waiters and want to develop their skills in the beauty industry,” Mamaz said. <img class="wp-image-535154 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Some-of-the-past-graduands-from-the-beauty-academy.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Some-of-the-past-graduands-from-the-beauty-academy.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Some-of-the-past-graduands-from-the-beauty-academy-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Some of the past graduands from the beauty academy Mangako Health and Beauty Academy has its main head office in Bramley, north of Johannesburg. It also has satellite branches in and around Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town. Mamaz said the academy’s vision is to become one of Africa’s leading skill and personal development centres. “At Mangako Beauty Academy, young women are groomed, taught and nurtured to be the best. Whether you’re a full time professional, part-time worker, someone looking for a career change or starting your own beauty venture, it’s never too late to learn.” She said the company’s humble beginnings over a decade ago have been due to hard work and having faith in God. “Contrary to popular belief, this work is not easy and has a lot of hidden layers to it. We aren’t the same as people, some are naturally fast learners, while others take longer to grasp things so I make sure that I help each person until we’re all content and then they qualify to work in the beauty field,” she said. With a zeal to assist those back home, she said she is now planning on making inroads in Zimbabwe by offering at first, free services to the country’s general populace as the goal is to redefine the beauty industry. <img class="size-full wp-image-535156" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Charity-Sizani-Tshuma-aka-Mamaz-with-the-beauty-academy-staff.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Charity-Sizani-Tshuma-aka-Mamaz-with-the-beauty-academy-staff.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Charity-Sizani-Tshuma-aka-Mamaz-with-the-beauty-academy-staff-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Charity Sizani Tshuma aka Mamaz with the beauty academy staff “In the coming months, we’re planning to come down to Zimbabwe and host a workshop for free. We want to help those who’re not privileged to continue with varsity or high school, but want to make ends meet,” Mamaz said. This past weekend, 40 people graduated from the academy. Tshuma said some of the graduates now work at affluent places in Dubai and Europe while some run their own spas. Recently, the beauty academy cemented itself as an innovator in the field of beauty training following the clinching of a strategic partnership with Sorbet, along with several trailblazing achievements in the past year alone. – @mthabisi_mthire
