BULAWAYO-based dancehall/reggae artiste, Seh Mac (real name Macnore Sibanda) is set to release a single in honour of the late legendary musician, Soul Jah Love. Chibaba as he was affectionately known, died on February 16 and Seh Mac says he wants to honour him for his immense contribution to the music industry through a single titled RIP Makuruwani. The song is due to be released on 1 April. “Soul Jah Love was a teacher because through his music, he managed to relay valuable cultural information to the public. At one point, I mingled with him at his Mbare studios hence I decided to produce this track to celebrate his legacy,” Seh Mac said. He said he is out to conquer in the music industry as he has landed an international collaboration with USA-based Jamaica musician, Dynamo Y13. The two are working on a track titled Bad Mind People set to be released on April 18. “2021 is a year I want to make my presence felt. In that light, I’m working on an international collaboration which is going to be released on the 18th of April.” Seh Mac said he has also set his eyes on collaborating with South African artistes, among them DJ Call Me and Caltonic. The musician is not new to international collaborations as his talent has been recognised as far as Jamaica where he also recently lured artiste, Natural Image from that country for a collaboration. The song titled Whine Your Waist was produced by Bulawayo’s BmC and managed to get airplay in stations in Jamaica and the United States of America. Seh Mac is yet to release an album but has a string of singles that include Mangoma Takapasa and Mumwe Musikana. He has managed to share the stage with the likes of Ti Gonzi, Bazooka, Seh Calaz and Jah Signal. — @mthabisi_mthire
