The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter SOUTH African-based Zimbabwean boxer Elvis Moyo is racing against time to acquire a passport to enable him to fight in a March 26 bill against Romanian Bogdan Marius Dinu in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. The Bulawayo Bomber, as Moyo goes by in the ring, will be making a return to the ring after two years of inactivity when he takes on Dinu in the fight dubbed “#RUMBLEINDA2”. In a telephone interview from his Johannesburg base on Thursday afternoon, Moyo remains hopeful he will get a passport and travel for the fight. “My passport has expired, but I had already applied for a new one. I submitted the application last month and I’m hopeful I’ll get it. The thing is because of Covid-19, the Zimbabwean consulate had closed and the appointment I was given was rescheduled. However, despite this passport matter, I remain committed and focused on my training,” said Moyo. The Bulawayo Bomber has nine career wins, five losses and two draws and is in desperate for a fight to improve his rankings. – @ZililoR
