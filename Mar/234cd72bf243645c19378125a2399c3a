The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent With social gatherings now permitted, although with a limited number of 50 people, arts outfit Victory Siyanqoba is now looking at making a comeback through their Eziko Theatre Laboratory, a fete meant at promoting young artistes. Victory Siyanqoba director, Desire Moyoxide said they have put out a roadmap of reclaiming their viability in the arts industry. “We’ve worked on a strategic roadmap cognisant of the WHO Covid-19 standards. This will be unrolled by March 8. As a community-based creative and cultural organisation whose sole purpose is to deliver fundamental messages to the most marginalised and cautions to the most uncouth, we’ve built up a 2021 generation that’ll bring unique social commentary edutainment to all communities, civic partners and local arts circles,” said Moyoxide. Since March last year, Victory Siyanqoba has kept social ills on their toes and leaders on check. “Eziko Theatre Laboratory opens this month for local artistes under the theme Corona Fighters- Vaccine for All. This will see the November 2020 setup of the venue and the new normal strategies of holding arts events at play,” he said. In November last year, the group hosted a Covid-19 cautions session of Eziko in partnership with Phiri Events Solutions, Kaisa Audio Works, Veins Media and Nkulumane Ward 22 local councillor. – @mthabisi_mthire
