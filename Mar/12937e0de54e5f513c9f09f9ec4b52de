WHO will lead the Warriors’ strikeforce when they take on Botswana and Zambia in Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers in three weeks’ time? This must be the question on the minds of Warriors’ fans following reports that most strikers called up for national duty might not be available for the two crucial assignments. <img class="wp-image-535318 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Knox-Mutizwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Knox-Mutizwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Knox-Mutizwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Knox Mutizwa Red-hot France-based striker Tinotenda Kadewere has been ruled out after his club exercised its right to bar him from travelling for the games fearing that the star will be forced to quarantine for six days as part of that country’s Covid-19 regulations. Admiral Muskwe from English Championship side Wycombe Wanderers and Scotland-based David Moyo, who is in the books of Hamilton Academical, are also doubtful for the assignments. Last week Aston Villa barred midfielder Marvelous Nakamba from travelling for the Warriors’ games because of tighter Covid-19 regulations implemented by the British government, which placed Zimbabwe in its red zone of travellers. The new guideliness state that anyone who travels to the red zone countries will quarantine for 10 days at an airport hotel on arrival. On Saturday, Tanzania-based Prince Dube, who earned the Warriors a point in their previous Afcon qualifier against Algeria last November by scoring the equaliser in the 2-2 draw, pulled a hamstring 27 minutes into their goalless draw away at Mwadul. Dube will be out for at least two weeks, which means by the time Zimbabwe travels to Botswana for the March 25 fixture, the striker will still be trying to regain fitness. Orlando Pirates striker Terence Dzukamanja is recovering from an ankle knock and missed the Sea Robbers’ 3-0 hammering of Chippa United at the weekend. Another striker called up Evans Rusike continued with his goal-draught as his SuperSport United outfit drew 0-0 with TS Galaxy. Durban-based Knox Mutizwa was on target for Lamontville Golden Arrows in their 3-1 win over Black Leopards. Mutizwa is the only Warriors’ forward that was on target at the weekend as he continued with his fine form at Arrows. The former Bosso striker’s fine form saw him being recalled to the Warriors’ set-up after being overlooked for the back-to-back qualifiers against Algeria last November. The other striker that coach Loga has called up is Bulawayo Chiefs’ Farau Matare, who like other locally-based players, has been inactive due to Covid-19. The good news though is that skipper Knowledge Musona is back to fitness after playing his first full game at the weekend after a long injury lay-off. Musona scored a brace in Saturday’s 3-3 home draw against OH Leuven. Loga named Musona, who can also play as a striker, as part of his midfielders. The Warriors captain has always been dependable and scored in the 2-2 draw with Algeria. -— @ZililoR
