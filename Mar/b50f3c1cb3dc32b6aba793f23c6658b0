The National Darts Association of Zimbabwe (Ndaz) has appealed to the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) to be included among sports allowed to resume activities. The SRC last week said Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Minister Kirsty Coventry had given 24 sport codes the nod to resume after deeming them low risk. Sporting activities in the country were iced in January after the country went into a tighter lockdown following a sudden spike in Covid-19 infections and deaths. Sport codes classified as low risk rose by seven from 15 last year. Despite darts not being a contact sport, it wasn’t named among the green-lighted codes. “We didn’t expect to be left out as darts. Correspondence with authorities to have us included as part of low risk sport has since been activated. We hope our plea will be heard,” said Ndaz president Meynard Moyo. Ndaz was named among the best run national sports associations (NSAs) at the annual national sports awards run by the SRC.
It was also among the few NSAs complaint with the SRC Act. Moyo’s executive has worked flat out in past couple of years to demistify public perception that darts is a game for drunkards and hence an uncontrolled sport. The move paid dividends as the game is now fully recognised by the National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash), which has now included the sport in its curriculum.
