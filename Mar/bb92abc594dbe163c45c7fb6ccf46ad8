The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter A new fashion brand, ZimXcite has inked several international merchandising deals with local creatives, a development which will see artistes being able to sell their works or branded merchandise to global markets. The development is an opportunity for artistes to get extra revenue especially considering the indefinite suspension of all social, cultural, leisure and recreational activities owing to the pervasiveness of the Covid-19 pandemic. The assortment of products on offer includes artwork on canvas/ framed wall art, branded merchandise on items like clothing, mugs, stickers, backpacks, laptop/phone cases, tote bags, jewellery, pillowcases and even blankets. A proliferating list with all-round creatives, among those who can now enjoy an international reach through the Zim Arts online shop are musicians Kelly Rusike, DJ King Her, Amy and the Calamities, Batsirai Shasha, Flying Bantu, wildlife photographer Tom Varley, Lemington Muzhingi (pencil artist), Karin Annan (painter), Derwin Graphics (pen artist/illustrator), as well as authors Brad Pohl and Hayden Eastwood, the latter who has written two books on learning how to speak Shona. There are also comedians and Zimbabwean films in this new Zim Arts initiative, including “A Township Story”, a forthcoming film by Sydney Taivavashe, the director behind the Pan African Film Festival award-winning movie, Gonarezhou. Established by Zimbabwean singer/songwriter, marketing consultant and film composer Ryan Koriya last year, ZimXcite started shipping all sorts of fun Zim words and phrases printed onto t-shirts, hoodies and mugs to help strike up interesting conversations about the Southern African country’s great land and its vibrant culture. Now, going beyond just sharing Zimbabwean-inspired humour, trivia and culture, the label is now promoting a fun spirit of inclusion, global diversity and is spotlighting Zimbabwe as an attractive holiday destination with its diverse cultures and trailblazing creatives.
