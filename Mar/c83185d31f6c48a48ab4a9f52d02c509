BULAWAYO Volleyball Association (BVA) chairperson William Mazviro says they face a huge financial challenge in their quest to resume games and consultations are underway on how best to do it. Cabinet gave the green light for all sports in the country to resume and the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) has made it clear that the onus is on individual National Sports Associations (NSAs) to prove they can financially sustain their activities. This could see most associations struggling to resume activities as sponsorship is a challenge for almost all sport codes in the country. “We are obviously pleased with the latest developments regarding our game. We are meeting as an executive on Saturday to discuss a wide range of issues on the way forward. It is not easy, the costs are really prohibitive but we are confident that we will come up with a solid strategy so that we have our game starting,” said Mazviro. At national level, Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) president Mxolisi Ndlovu said they were putting in place necessary protocols and once approved, they will return to the court. “We are working on the necessary protocols and once approved we resume games. What is important is to make sure we safely return,” Ndlovu said. During the course of inactivity last year, BVA established various committees in a bid to make its brand more marketable and reach out to stakeholders more effectively. – @innocentskizoe
