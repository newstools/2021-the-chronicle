The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls VICTORIA Falls-based Zifa Southern Region Division One side Mosi Rovers have employed football administrator and consultant Brian Moyo as the club’s new chief executive officer. The experienced administrator, who opened a consultancy firm Sportsplus more than a year ago, is already in the resort town and his mandate is to grow the ambitious club’s brand and guide it into the topflight league. “I am already at work and we must acknowledge that this is a young and growing project, but big in desire and potential. The idea is to help the young club grow in stature and in the long term eventually bring Premier Soccer League football to Victoria Falls,” said Moyo. Mosi Rovers also hired experienced coach Try Ncube last year and mandated him to bring topflight football to the country’s tourism capital for the first time in history. However, Moyo said there are many determinants to joining the elite league other than just winning on the field of play. He said he was encouraged by the presence of a viable tourism industry, which presents potential that can be unlocked in the football fraternity. “I am here to put down markers and a foundation from which a successful brand can be built,” said Moyo. Mosi Rovers chairman Martin Mhlanga said recruiting Moyo is in line with the club’s strategic vision. “As part of the club’s growth and development, the board felt it was time to get a chief executive to propel the club forward. He comes in to help fulfil the organisational aspirations of bringing elite football to the tourism city,” Mhlanga said. He said the team was ready to return to the field once the green light is given post, as the community has been starved of football. – @ncubeleon
