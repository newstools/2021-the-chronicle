FASHION designer, Nkanyezi Malunga, who is the founder of Ganu Designs, will next week spearhead a project where she will raise awareness on Covid-19 among women in rural areas through fashion. Through the project which she has named “Vikela”, Malunga is expecting to train about 150 women between 25 and 50 years in Tsholotsho, Nyamandlovu, uMzingwane, Lupane and Matobo how to produce protective clothing such as face masks among other things. The project is expected to start on Monday. Malunga said the training aims to teach women on the production of protective clothing in an easy format they will grasp quickly and be able to share with other women in the community. “At the same event, healthcare professionals will educate women on the different aspects of Covid-19 which include, but not limited to, symptoms, care and prevention tools and mechanisms as well as demystifying myths associated with the vaccination,” said Malunga.
She said women should be able to have sustainable revenue streams. “The training will be conducted in such a manner that is easy for women to share knowledge with others, thus capturing and empowering a larger segment of them when the project is long done. “When this project comes to an end, we hope that it would have empowered women to be able to generate revenue from this social enterprise going forth. We want to see women in their prime productivity, fending for their families while contributing to the local economy.” The fashion designer added that through this project, she hopes to close the gap of production and supply of protective clothing. “There’s a huge gap in the production and supply of protective clothing. Therefore, beyond this training, women should be able to feed into the supply chain of protective clothing which also covers other sectors such as mining and agriculture,” said Malunga.
