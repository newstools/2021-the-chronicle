Highlanders members that meet requirements of Article 10.4 of the club’s constitution will be allowed to vote on Sunday, nomination court secretary Cosmos Sikhosana has said. Bosso members meet this Sunday to vote for the club chairman, secretary and committee member, with six candidates, two for each post, vying for office. Incumbent chairman Kenneth Mhlophe is being challenged by Johnfat Sibanda while Morgan “Gazza” Dube seeking to replace Israel Moyo as secretary. Mgcini Mafu and Bheka Sibanda are vying for the vacant committee member’s position that was held by Wisdom Mabhena, who has served the mandatory two terms. “Registration of members goes on throughout the year but voting is in line with Article 10.4 of the Highlanders constitution,” said Sikhosana. Article 10.4 reads: “At such election, each member shall be entitled to only one vote in respect of each contested position, voting shall be by secret ballot and in the event of a tie, the returning officer shall have a casting vote and only those who have held valid membership cards for at least 12 months immediately before the ballot shall be eligible to attend and vote at all general meetings.” Concern had been raised regarding the issue of members being allowed to continue regularising their membership even after the initial 7 February election date. Those renewing their membership status now have an obligation to prove to the polling officers that they were bona fide members. Polling agents must satisfy themselves that the members intending to vote are qualified. Each candidate will be allowed up to three polling agents.
