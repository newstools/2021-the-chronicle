The Chronicle MIKE TYSON has rejected a £21,5 million offer for the trilogy fight against Evander Holyfield at the Hard Rock Stadium in May. The heavyweight star turned down the chance to face Holyfield at the 65 000 capacity Miami stadium on May 29. Mike Tyson has rejected the offer to face Evander Holyfield in Miami in May. Holyfield’s manager Kris Lawrence said: “We thought this was a done deal but it quickly fell apart when Tyson’s people declined all offers.
“We were negotiating in good faith all along and it appears we just ended up wasting our time.” Tyson announced he was returning to the ring at the end of May at the Hard Rock Cafe, the home of the Miami Dolphins. But the boxer’s demands have reportedly scuppered any prospect of the long-awaited third fight against Holyfield taking place in May. The heavyweight legend made a shock return to the sport last year after an exhibition draw against Roy Jones Jr. Holyfield was in talks with Tyson’s camp to deliver the trilogy fight. The 58-year-old told SunSport: “What I can tell you is that my team is talking to Mike’s management, so I’m waiting for a decision. They are communicating right now. “The thing is I’m still training for this, I know it will be some day this deal will happen and I’m ready for him. I’m doing OK.” Tyson was stunned by Holyfield in their first fight in 1996 after a dramatic defeat. And the rematch a year later was infamously ended after Tyson was disqualified for biting the champion’s ear. But it appears boxing fans will have to wait longer for the third fight to take place after Tyson rejected the offer to face Holyfield in Miami in May.
