A TEENAGER from Nsimbi Village in Guyu, Gwanda drowned in Nsimbi Dam while swimming on Tuesday. Khumbulani Ndlovu (19) drowned when he decided to swim on his way back home from the fields where he had gone to deliver food to family members who were working there. Matabeleland South provincial police spokesperson Inspector Loveness Mangena confirmed the incident. “I can confirm a drowning case which happened in Guyu on Tuesday in the afternoon where a 19-year-old boy drowned in Nsimbi Dam. On Tuesday Ndlovu was sent together with his cousin to the fields to give food to the people who were working in the fields. On their way back, the two decided to pass by the dam where Ndlovu thought of swimming,” said Insp Mangena. “He took off his clothes and jumped into the dam to swim before he drowned. When he started drowning, the cousin noticed it and ran home to tell the grandmother who sought help from the villagers. The body could not be retrieved the same day but was seen on Wednesday floating. The police suspected no foul play and handed over the body to the family for burial.” Insp Mangena urged members of the public to guard against embarking in activities that may result in unnecessary loss of life. “We urge members of the public not to swim in water bodies which are not meant for swimming,” She said. — @jdgjarachara
