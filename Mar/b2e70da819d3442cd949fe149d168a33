NYARADZO Group yesterday handed PPEs to Zimpapers Bulawayo branch staffers as an expression of appreciation to the organisation. Speaking during the handover that also included t-shirts and other accessories, the Nyaradzo Group Bulawayo branch manager Mr Habakuk Garakara said the media is one of the essential service organisations that never closed. He said the media played a critical role during the pandemic through the dissemination of information that calmed the population during the precarious times. “We are just here to express our gratitude to the work that you are doing, we are also grateful for the support that you continue to give us and as the biggest funeral service provider in the country we always feel obligated to also play our part in preserving lives,” he said. Mr Garakara also highlighted that Zimpapers and Nyaradzo Group always support each other in various ways and the presentation was a token and a sign of friendship that has existed for years. “Our first support comes from you and when it comes to the pandemic, we would not have fought this war without you and both of us have stepped in as front liners of this war and we continue to play a huge role. We must keep urging each other in terms of our own safety,” he said. Speaking on behalf of Zimpapers, Sunday News Editor Limukani Ncube applauded Nyaradzo Group for the gesture. “We are grateful for such an act of kindness and we are also grateful that there are people who continue to appreciate the work that we do,” said Ncube.
