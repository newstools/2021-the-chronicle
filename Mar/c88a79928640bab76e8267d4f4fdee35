POLICE in Bulawayo have impounded 120 pirate taxis and rounded up 30 touts in a two-day blitz under “Operation no to pirate kombis, no to mshikashika.” The operation which involves the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) and Vehicle Inspection Department (VID) came into effect on Monday.
By 3pm yesterday kombis, buses, Honda Fit and private cars had been netted. Police have said vehicle owners who allow their cars to be used to illegally carry passengers, would be arrested. Last Friday, pirate kombi drivers ganged up with rogue elements and attacked traffic police officers before smashing the rear windscreen of a police car and stealing a car battery which was in the boot. On Monday the police mounted roadblocks on all roads leading to the city centre in a crackdown on pirate taxis that left commuters stranded. Scores of commuters had to walk more than two kilometres to get to the city centre as pirate taxis dropped them off just before the roadblocks. Government has said that the Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (Zupco) is the country’s sole public transporter, thereby outlawing private players. Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube, speaking at a Press conference at Ross Camp in Bulawayo yesterday said the operation seeks to clamp down on illegal vehicles which have taken advantage of the lockdown relaxation to return to the roads. “This operation which started yesterday has seen a total 120 vehicles, kombis, buses, and private cars being impounded. A total of 30 touts were detained and will appear in court soon. “We noted that these touts were becoming rowdy and have a mindset of attacking police officers. Last week they vandalised a police vehicle, yesterday a police officer was attacked at Mzilikazi/Makokoba. We want that to stop. The police will not only charge drivers but the owners of the vehicles too for allowing their vehicles to be used illegally,” said Insp Ncube. <img class="wp-image-536650 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Drivers-and-owners-of-impounded-vehicles-wait-outside-Ross-Camp-Police-yard-in-Bulawayo-yesterday.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Drivers-and-owners-of-impounded-vehicles-wait-outside-Ross-Camp-Police-yard-in-Bulawayo-yesterday.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/Drivers-and-owners-of-impounded-vehicles-wait-outside-Ross-Camp-Police-yard-in-Bulawayo-yesterday-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Drivers and owners of impounded vehicles wait outside Ross Camp Police yard in Bulawayo yesterday The operation involves Bulawayo Central Police, BCC, Traffic police and the VID. “The team will work together to arrest and detain touts who have been mobilising unemployed youths to be violent on law enforcers,” said Insp Ncube.
