THE sport, arts and recreation sector in Bulawayo province on Monday joined the rest of the world in celebrating International Women’s Day. They celebrated the day under the theme #choose the challenge. Provincial sports and recreation officer Rita Kutsirai said it was their endeavor to create greater spaces of equality for women in sport. “This year we continue celebrating this day under the theme #choose the challenge. As a province we managed to hold a walk with our male colleagues to mark the journey women have travelled. We have also profiled women in sport that have walked the journey in sports. We are encouraging men to walk the path with us in celebrating this day as we say men can do nothing for us without us, hence men should be part of this journey for the development of our nation,” said Kutsirai. “As SRC Bulawayo province, we are saying women are an integral part of the community and an important part of the nation. As we work, we work with men who are calling on men to support as we aim to build a better nation through working. We urge the entire nation to all support our women in sport,” said Kutsirai. – @innocentskizoe
