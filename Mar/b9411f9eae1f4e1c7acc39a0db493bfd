HIGH flying gospel musician, Everton Mlalazi is over the moon as he has clinched a collaboration with famed South African gospel musician, Benjamin Dube for his forthcoming album set for release next month. Mlalazi is riding high with his latest single, Pfugama Unamate, a collaboration with Minister Mike Mahendere which was released last month and is topping radio gospel charts. The single is a follow up to another single, Uyingcwele that was produced last year and topped the Star FM gospel greats charts for five consecutive weeks. Mlalazi said he cannot wait to release the album which will be a compilation of singles. “I intend to release the album titled ‘In the Presence’ which will be a compilation of my old singles but will also have new music. It’ll be released next month and will feature Bishop Benjamin Dube who I’m grateful to be working with. Our collaboration is under production,” said Mlalazi. The musician who sings in isiNdebele, Zulu, Shona and English said through his music, he wants people to experience love, healing, joy, peace and forgiveness especially during these difficult times when the world is grappling the Covid-19 pandemic. “I believe that God gave me the talent to minister the glad tidings or good news of salvation through song. I discovered my talent in singing when I was just five as I joined my dad and other family members in singing during a devotion at home. That’s how I fell in love with singing and never turned back,” he said. In January this year, Mlalazi, a member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, collaborated with former Joyous Celebration member Xolly Mncwango on a single titled ‘My Father’s House’. Mlalazi’s music is available on platforms such as iTunes, Spotify, Deezer and YouTube and the latest album will also be available on the same platforms. Hard copies will also be produced for those who cannot access the digital platforms. — @themkhust
