THE construction of Palm River Hotel, Victoria Falls’ new luxurious hotel, is almost complete with the facility expected to open its doors to the public in July. Spencers Creek Pvt Ltd in partnership with Old Mutual Zimbabwe invested approximately US$24,6 million in land and construction of the 71-room hotel. The new business venture targets travellers from across the globe that want to experience Africa’s natural world wonder — the Victoria Falls, Mighty Zambezi River, abundant wildlife and the rich history of the resort town environs. President Mnangagwa visited the hotel which was under construction in August last year when he launched the US$5 billion National Tourism Recovery and Growth Strategy. The idyllic location of The Palm River Hotel under a canopy of indigenous trees is expected to offer an unmatched panoramic view of Zambezi River and Game Park, four kilometres away from town. The new hotel is part of the Ilala Hotel Group and is expected to boost tourism not only in Victoria Falls but the entire country. <img class="alignnone wp-image-547331 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/KLKDO.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/KLKDO.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/KLKDO-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Responding to emailed questions, Ilala Lodge Hotel general manager, Miss Heather Kay, said The Palm River Hotel will welcome guests on 1 July. She said construction of Block A (Acacia) and Block B (Baobab) made up of predominantly Deluxe rooms and presidential suite along with a refreshing 20 metre infinity pool are now complete and await the arrival of the first guests. Block C (Combretum) and the main area including the reception, dining hall, bar and fresco restaurant are having final touches in preparation for the opening. The construction of Block D (Duiker-berry), Block E (Ebony) Block F (Fig) is also underway with completion scheduled for November 2021. The hotel will have a total of 71 rooms comprising 60 Deluxe rooms including two wheelchair accessible rooms, two deluxe suites, two honeymoon suites, two family suites, three executive suites, one presidential suite and one Palm River Villa inclusive of three bedrooms. Management says the hotel seeks to offer unmatched elegance. “Elegantly appointed with comfort and space in mind, the interior design of the rooms is focused on bringing the outside in, with the stylish use of natural tones, locally sourced materials and artwork reflective of the area,” said Miss Kay. “The tastefully modern style of the Queenslander is reflected in the inside as well as the outside, and introduces a new dimension of luxury, providing guests with every modern convenience to make their stay as comfortable as possible while maintaining the old-world charm that is the essence of Victoria Falls.” The well-placed rooms offer expansive and tranquil riverside garden from the bedroom balcony experience with unsolicited view of wildlife allowing guests to feel up-close and personal with the Mighty Zambezi River. There is also river deck on the edge of Zambezi River and a large alfresco dining area under a canopy of trees to offer an A’la carte restaurant, an outdoor bar, conferencing and events facilities, a pool that transforms into a star lit wonder-lit with the use of cleverly illuminated rocks and lighting. Miss Kay said once the business is operational there will be a complementary shuttle bus from the city centre connecting key landmarks sought after by tourists. -@ncubeleon
