ZIFA Southern Region Division One Soccer League clubs will stick to fixtures drawn last year, before the 2020 season was forced to a halt because of the global Covid-19 pandemic. The league released fixtures to the clubs “long back”, with Zifa Southern Region board member Fiso Siziba who is responsible for the competitions portfolio saying issuing the league programme was meant to help teams plan. Earlier release helps clubs plan for their away trips, formulate budgets so that they cover issues to do with transport as well as referees’ fees when they are playing at home. In 2019, the season when Bulawayo City FC won the championship and the Premiership ticket, the Southern Region Division One Soccer League had 15 clubs. Only one club, Toronto FC from Pumula East in Bulawayo was relegated. The Region welcomes back Hwange who were relegated from the topflight at the end of 2019. For the coming season, 18 teams will compete for the championship. Crestfallen former Premiership giants Zimbabwe Saints who are on a revival path were readmitted to the First Division last year after clearing all their arrears. Saints have been in the football doldrums since 2016 when they were kicked out of the Zifa Southern Region Division One for failing to pay affiliation fees and not fulfilling three consecutive fixtures. Chauya Chikwata will face stiff competition from clubs that include Talen Vision who go into the 2021 season among the favourites having been busy beefing up their squad with experienced players who include Zephaniah Ngodzo, Canaan Nkomo, Mengezi Dube and Mkhokheli Dube among others. Hwange, Victoria Falls’ Mosi Rovers and perennial campaigners ZPC Hwange are sure to give Saints a good run in the second-tier league. The other clubs that join clubs that were in the league in 2019 are Emakhandeni Pirates and Quality Foods from the Bulawayo Metropolitan Province as well as Trumus from Victoria Falls. The 13 clubs that were in the league in 2019 after promotion of Bulawayo City to the Premiership and relegation of Toronto are Talen Vision, ZPC Hwange, Makomo, Indlovu Iyanyathela, Highlanders FC development side Bosso 90, Ciwu, Binga Pirates, Ajax Hotspurs of Mpopoma, goldminers Casmyn, Plumree’s Mainline, Mosi Rovers, armyside Motomoto, and Arenel. Talen Vision open their season with a home tie against Trumus, while Zimbabwe Saints will be home as well to ZPC Hwange while the coalminers Hwange, who are hoping for a quick Premiership return start their campaign against Ciwu at the Colliery.
