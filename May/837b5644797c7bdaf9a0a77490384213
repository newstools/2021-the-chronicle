The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA Southern Region Division One Soccer League clubs have 19 days to pay up the US$2 000 affiliation fee or risk losing their franchises. The Zifa Southern Region announced at their annual general meeting held last Saturday that the affiliation fee has been pegged at US$2 000 despite protests from clubs who felt the amount was excessive in light of eroded incomes during the Covid-19 lockdown. Clubs sought to have the amount lowered but the executive insisted that to effectively run the league the fees should remain the same. The executive argued they had in fact reduced the fees from the previous U$2 500. Augustine Ndlovu, Zifa Southern Region administrator sent clubs affiliation fees invoices, that were accompanied by a message notifying them that the deadline is May 30. “Please take note the deadline for payment is 30 May 2021. Failure to meet the deadline will mean that you will lose your franchise,” reads part of the invoice Ndlovu sent to clubs. Clubs have also been given May 31 as the deadline for registration, with venue inspections to be done by 22 May. Compliance officers are set to be trained next weekend to ensure clubs are not in breach of Covid-19 protocols. The clubs have been told to prepare to fork out referees and Covid-19 tests expenses despite Zifa having indicated they will bear the expense. The clubs told the Zifa Southern Region leadership that the governing body should live up to its promises and cater for these costs. -@ZililoR
