The Chronicle Mehluli Sibanda, Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN Lucky Mlilo was elected Squash Federation of Africa president at the federation’s virtual annual general meeting held last Friday. Mlilo received 15 of the 18 votes cast, with each of his challengers getting one vote each. The 56-year-old was up against Boye Oyerinde of Nigeria, Adrian Wehrli (Mauritius) and Khaled El Agroudy of Egypt. He becomes the first black African to hold the position since the organisation’s formation in 1992. Mlilo took over the position which fell vacant after the death of Egyptian Hany Hamouda last year. Hamouda, who died of Covid-19 complications, had held the position for eight years and his term was due to expire this year. By virtue of being president of SFA, Mlilo is now a board member of the World Squash Federation (WSF). Zimbabwe, Egypt, Central African Republic, Zambia, Lesotho, South Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Zanzibar, Namibia, Ghana, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Eswatini, Sudan, DR Congo, Mauritius and Nigeria are the countries that took part in the AGM. Mlilo, a Bulawayo-based business executive and consultant, said he was flattered to land the position of SFA president. “It’s an honour to be in charge of SFA in a continent of 55 countries, with 30 squash playing countries and to represent Africa on the World Squash Federation executive board,” said Mlilo. He said his immediate task is to set up committees and the process of amending the SFA constitution, which has not been revised since 1992. “As indicated in my election manifesto, there are a number of tasks ahead, but the first will be the creation of committees and the amendment of the constitution which was crafted in 1992 and now has a lot of grey areas that need to be aligned in line with the WSF vision and mission,” Mlilo said. Mlilo is also chairman of the Squash Rackets Association of Zimbabwe and a squash referee. – @Mdawini_29
