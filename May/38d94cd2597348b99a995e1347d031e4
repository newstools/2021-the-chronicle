Turning to the last showcase at Pumula suburb last Friday, Ngwabi said the project is getting much support from a number of people. “This time around, we had Bulawayo Progressive Residents Association assisting with relevant information on how to deal with sexual assault cases while Yellow World, a youth-led arts association assisted with refreshments. <img class="wp-image-548541 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Indodakazi-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Indodakazi-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Indodakazi-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Pumula residents watch the Indodakazi-Mwanasikana play “The former headboy of Northlea High School assisted our cast and crew with transport while Zizo Motion Pictures mobilised Pumula residents to come. Nhimbe Trust and Ibrah Magazine assisted with shooting equipment. It was amazing to see all these organisations assisting. “The residents from Pumula stressed mostly on the fact that children and women not knowing their rights, leads to them being violated or abused,” said Ngwabi. – @mthabisi_mthire
