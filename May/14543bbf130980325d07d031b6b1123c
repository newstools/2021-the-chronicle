The Chronicle The death toll in a horrific bombing at a girls’ school in the Afghan capital has soared to 50, many of them pupils between 11 and 15 years old, the Interior Ministry said yesterday. The number of wounded in Saturday’s attack has also climbed to more than 100, said Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian. Three explosions outside the school entrance struck as students were leaving for the day, he said. The blasts occurred in a mostly Shiite neighborhood in the west of the capital. The Taliban denied responsibility, condemning the attack. The first explosion came from a vehicle packed with explosives, followed by two others, said Arian, adding that the casualty figures could still rise. The attack targeted Afghanistan’s ethnic Hazaras who dominate the western Dasht-e-Barchi neighbourhood, where the bombings occurred. Most Hazaras are Shiite Muslims.-AFP.
