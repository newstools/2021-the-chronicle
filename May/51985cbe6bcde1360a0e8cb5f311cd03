GWERU City Council is planning to implement recommendations of a job evaluation exercise as it fights to reduce its $50million wage bill. Mayor Councillor Josiah Makombe said the local authority was in the process of implementing a job evaluation report which was generated in 2015 by PricewaterhouseCoopers. “Our current establishment is around 1 320 and after the job evaluation it will be around 790. Our wage bill is around $50 million and about 49 percent of our billing only is being paid,” he said. Cllr Makombe said council is struggling to provide service to residents because of the huge wage bill and residents who are not settling their bills. “We are struggling due to non-payment by residents and stakeholders. Some have not been paying since 2013 and this has affected the council in the provision of quality service delivery,” he said. Cllr Makombe said the job evaluation is a process which will take time. “We are not going to lay anyone off. The job evaluation is a process and it will take time. What we will do is that we will not replace those who would have retired and the deceased until we reach the new establishment. So there will be no loss of employment for anyone,” he said. Cllr Makombe said the local authority is coming up with a new structure which will be very effective in providing service delivery at the same time saving money. “Like I said, it is a process but good for the city. The good thing is that once it’s fully implemented the city will save a lot,” he said. The Mayor said there will be no more permanent employment for casual workers adding that move alone is saving money. “Meaning we can only engage casual labour for specific tasks if there is need, for example grass cutting during the rain seasons. “We also want to remove other top positions which are not necessary and which can be done by one office,” said Cllr Makombe.”
