MUSIC promoter and businessman, Dave “Madamara” Ncube, the first promoter to bring South African musician, Freddie Gwala to the country, was buried on Wednesday. Ncube (53), who died on Monday at his home after battling a kidney ailment for the past 20 years, was buried at Athlone Cemetery in Bulawayo. The burial was attended by close friends and family due to Covid-19 restrictions. Madamara, as Dave became popularly known in entertainment circles because of his promotion of Gwala, nicknamed Amadamara, started his career in music promotions in the early 90s. This saw him bring several musicians into the country, most of them from South Africa. His brother, Nicholas Ncube said Madamara was an enterprising businessman who was focused on bringing the best in live music in the region. He said he also dabbled in running entertainment joints, at one time, managing Metropolis Pub and Grill at Ascot Shopping Centre, a bar in North End and bars at Selbourne Hotel. <img class="alignnone wp-image-549093 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-13-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-13-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-13-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Madamara, inspired by Jeffrey JJ Chavunduka, a promoter of note in the early 80s, struck a working relationship with South African musicians that saw him bringing in a number of top artistes such as the Soul Brothers, Imitshotshovu, Lucky Dube, Chimora, Chicco, Dalom Kids, Dalom Music stable, Tisha and Gwala. Journalist, Lovemore Dube said the entertainment industry had lost a promoter of repute. He recalled how they would drive around the city visiting shebeens as they sought to gauge the mood of music lovers to determine which artiste could sell in a particular season. Dube said one of Ncube’s great acts was getting Lucky Dube to Uganda where he played before a crowd of 100 000. <img class="alignnone wp-image-549092 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-12-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-12-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-12-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “He was not just about promoting South African acts as locally, he held shows with the likes of Oliver Mtukudzi, Paul Matavire and Ilanga, among others. He made it a point to ensure local acts curtain-raised during every show,” Dube said. Dave Ncube is survived by his wife Rudo and four children.
