The Chronicle The final Premier League match week of the season has all matches kicking off at the same time, on Sunday at 5pm, with the battle for European football next season still to be decided. Chelsea travel to Aston Villa knowing a win secures a top-four finish. If the Blues drop points, they could be overtaken by both Liverpool and Leicester City. Liverpool host Crystal Palace at Anfield, while Leicester take on Tottenham Hotspur, who themselves need a win to have a chance of qualifying for next season’s Uefa Europa League. Spurs are relying on West Ham United losing to Southampton at the London Stadium. However, the Saints have lost nine of their previous 10 away fixtures in the Premier League. A win with a significant goal swing for Everton at Manchester City could see the Toffees claim sixth place, or at least finish seventh if they better Spurs’ result. Arsenal host Brighton & Hove Albion with a chance of qualifying for the Uefa Conference League should Spurs and Everton not record victories. The Gunners have won each of their last nine fixtures to end a Premier League season. Fulham vs Newcastle United gives Joe Willock the chance to emulate Tyneside legend Alan Shearer. Willock can become only the second Newcastle player to score in seven consecutive PL appearances, after the former Magpies striker. Match week 38 also features Leeds United vs West Bromwich Albion, Sheffield United vs Burnley and Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Manchester United. – Premier League
