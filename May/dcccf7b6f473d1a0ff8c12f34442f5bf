FARMERS should start preparing for the 2021/2022 summer cropping season by getting inputs on time and having their soils sampled and analysed for correct ‘pH to enhance increased yields. According to Agricultural Rural Development Authority (Arda) board chairperson, Mr Ivan Craig, soil sampling is crucial as it guides the farmers on the type of fertilisers he or she needs. “As farmers are harvesting the summer crops and preparing for winter planting, those not involved in winter cropping should start preparing for the coming summer cropping season,” he said in an interview in Bulawayo last Friday. Mr Craig said farmers should have their soils sampled and analysed so that they know the status of the soil and what fertilisers are needed.
He said preparations should start early if farmers are to realise good yields. Mr Craig said after checking their soil ‘pH, farmers can then acquire proper inputs. “I travelled around the country and observed that most farmers had a bumper harvest because of the good rains last season,” he said. Mr Craig urged farmers to deliver their produce to the Grain Marketing Board and said those with contracts should honour their contracts. He said urban farmers should also work closely with their Agritex extension officers as well as the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) to ensure proper preservation of the environment. Agritex officer in charge of Matabeleland North and Bulawayo, Mr Dumisani Nyoni, said the Friday prize giving ceremony, which saw farming inputs and equipment valued at US$7 000 being given out to winners, should motivate more farmers to take farming seriously. “We thank Bulawayo farmers for the great work. This prize giving ceremony confirms Government’s support to farmers,” he said.
