A MOTORIST was attacked and robbed of cash and cellphones all valued at more than R6 000 by two men he gave a lift along the Masvingo-Beitbridge Road. Mr Palmer Makativhu (46) of Marondera who was driving towards Beitbridge, picked his attackers at Ngundu Business Centre at around 9PM on Monday. Matabeleland South police spokesperson Inspector Loveness Mangena confirmed the robbery. “We received a report of a motorist who was robbed by two unknown men,” said Insp Mangena. She said Mr Makativhu was driving his Toyota Corolla along Masvingo-Beitbridge Road and upon arrival at Ngundu Business Centre, he picked up two men who had asked for a lift. Later on along the way they produced a knife and ordered Mr Makativhu to park in the bush where they robbed him of US$60, R50 and cellphones. Insp Mangena said the robbers fled from the scene with the cash and cellphones when a truck driver stopped to check what was going on.
She said Mr Makativhu reported the robbery at Beitbridge Police Station. Last year, a suspected gang of thieves armed with machetes and knobkerries robbed a motorist at night near Cross Dete along the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls highway and went away with two wheels, car battery, $3 000, US$200, cellphone, passport and other identity documents. — @michieroxy
