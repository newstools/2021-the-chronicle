The Chronicle A century by Anneke Bosch steered the South Africa emerging women to a 5-0 series sweep over Zimbabwe women after comfortably winning the final match of their one-day series by 69 runs at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Wednesday. Bosch blasted 109 runs off 100 balls, consisting of 11 fours and one six as South Africa posted 238 all out after being asked to bat first.
The home side managed just 169 for nine in reply despite batting out its 50 overs, with Christabel Chatonzwa top-scoring with 54 off 117 balls. Seamer Masabata Klaas was the best South African bowler, taking 2/21 in six overs. Bosch stood tall in an indifferent batting display with opener Annerie Dercksen’s 33 the next best score for South Africa. Bosch and Dercksen put on 80 for the third wicket stand, while adding 50 with Micaela Andrews (35) for the sixth wicket after a mid-innings stumble. That did enough to get Dinesha Devnarain’s team to a competitive total after being bundled out in the final over for 238. Zimbabwe’s reply was a struggle after Klaas struck twice as they limped to 37 for three in 15 overs. Chatonzwa and captain Josephine Nkomo (30) steadied the ship with a partnership of 64, although that took over 20 overs, keeping the pressure on the home side. Jade de Figueredo eventually broke the stand, leading to a flurry of wickets. There was one wicket each for Andrews, Nobulumko Baneti, Nondumiso Shangase and Jones, with Jane Winster also excellent, conceding just 15 runs in 10 overs, which included four maidens. – News24
