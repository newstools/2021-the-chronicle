The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN footballer Gabriel Nyoni’s recently launched range of perfumes called GN27 are now available for sale in Bulawayo. The Cape Umoya forward in the South African National First Division sustained severe broken foot bones during a GladAfrica Championship game a few months ago against Richards Bay FC. Doctors informed him that his playing career is uncertain. Two wires and three screws were inserted in his foot and he will know in a few months whether or not he will play football again. Nyoni took the misfortune in his stride and ventured into perfume manufacturing. He now manufactures 100 percent undiluted long-lasting oil-based perfumes inspired by Designer Brands. Since the launch of the product in April, the GN27 brand perfumes were being purchased online on http://gn27perfumes.com. “The GN27 perfumes have arrived in Bulawayo. We have our distributor, Faith Moyo, who can be contacted on +263 77 599 3525. The perfumes cost R199 and we accept all forms of payment. We also deliver anywhere in Bulawayo CBD. “The GN27 perfumes make you leave a positive impression wherever you go. They will know you are there without telling them you are there because they are long lasting. Designer perfumes are expensive so l made an alternative, but of the same quality and affordable for everyone to smell expensive. All my perfumes are inspired by big brands,” said Nyoni. Nyoni joined Cape Umoya in September last year from Maritzburg United where he had signed a two-year contract, with the option of a 12-month extension, but constant injury lay-offs resulted in him being offloaded. He scored his first goal for Cape Umoya in January against Uthongati. The speedy forward is a holder of a degree in marketing from the National University of Science and Technology. – @innocentskizoe
