The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter FORMER Highlanders’ forward Gabriel Nyoni has kept his lips tight about “big news” he will be announcing relating to Bosso on Thursday. Nyoni shared a video during his Bosso days on Wednesday captioned: “The day I left Highlanders. Never burn Bridges. Tomorrow announcing big news.” Asked what the big news is all about, Nyoni said all will be revealed on Thursday. “Highlanders did a lot for me than I did for them. They gave me a life in football. The chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube is a great man and Ndumiso Gumede as well, they are true professionals. It’s a matter of time before I work with them again as a player or in future as a coach or part of the administration, you never know. We live it in God’s hands,” Nyoni said. The Cape Umoya player in South Africa’s First Division recently launched a range of perfumes called GN27, which are now available for sale in Bulawayo. He’s been on the sidelines with severe broken foot bones sustained in a league match against Richards Bay FC in February and doctors informed him that he might not play again. Nyoni joined Cape Umoya in September last year from Maritzburg United where he had signed a two-year contract, with the option of a 12-month extension, but constant injury lay-offs resulted in him being offloaded. He scored his first goal for Cape Umoya in January against Uthongati. The speedy forward is also a holder of a degree in marketing from the National University of Science and Technology. – @innocentskizoe
