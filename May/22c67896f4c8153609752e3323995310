Award-winning hip-hop artiste, Mlue Jay (real name Mlungisi Moyo) is preparing to launch his debut album next month. The South Africa-based artiste said the album was inspired by his daughter, Donatella K Moyo, who was born when he was working on the album. As such, he named the album after her. The Bulawayo-born rapper who finally received a Zim Hip Hop award last year after being nominated for three years said: “Donatella drops on 11 June and it’s my first album that was inspired by my daughter. She was born as I was in the process of making the album. The album is very special to me because I experimented with something that I’ve never done before. “It was produced and engineered by Everything’s Ghost and Procava from Swaziland,” said Mlue Jay. He added that fans should look out for the songs he did with Brythreesixy, the late Cal Vin, Asaph, Dopey and GunxDapharoe NguDoni. As he prepares to launch the album, Mlue Jay rallied those back home to support him. He further emphasised the need for artistes to unite saying this will help them grow. Other than working on this album, Mlue Jay has been busy shooting music videos for artistes in South Africa. “I’ve been shooting music videos for some artistes here in South Africa and I’m in the process of learning and perfecting the skills of video production. I realised my potential in terms of doing videos when two of my videos were playlisted on MTV Base and Channel O,” he said. Mlue Jay made a name for himself when he released a house music track titled So Dangerous, which featured South African Smallz of the Money Maker fame.
