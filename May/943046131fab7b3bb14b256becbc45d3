The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter Despite growing international pressure for the Olympic Games to be cancelled, Zimbabwe Olympic Committee president Thabani Gonye said they will stand guided by resolutions of the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo Games’ organising committee. Gonye said Zoc will not be distracted by increasing cancellation calls, but remain fully focused on preparations for the Games. There has been increasing pressure for the Games to be cancelled or postponed, with over 80 percent Japanese citizens against hosting of the Games, according to latest polls, while an influential doctors’ association urged Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to consider calling off the Games. The weekend survey by the Asahi Shimbun daily found 43 percent respondents want the Games cancelled and 40 percent want a postponement. The figures are up from 35 percent that backed cancellation in a survey by the same newspaper a month ago and 34 percent that wanted a further delay. The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association, representing about 6000 primary care doctors, said hospitals in the Games’ host city have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity. However, Gonye told Chronicle Sport that they stand guided by the IOC and Tokyo 2020 committee, as they had faith in Covid-19 counter measures, play book and protocols that have been put in place during the team’s preparations.
