The Chronicle Joel Tsvakwi, Showbiz Correspondent NTABAZINDUNA-based sungura artist, D.T BiO Mudimba who has become a household name with his Kujata Jata single has explained the meaning of the song. The leader of Kaani Stars troupe said kujata jata is a Tonga word that means a person who likes to use juju in solving some of the problems encountered in life. “The song is talking about social life where in a family, children are having misfortunes in their love lives which prompts them to seek spiritual guidance from churches. They are told that in the family, there was once a granny who used juju. Unfortunately, she passed on and her juju is now causing bad luck for the grandchildren,” Bio Mudimba explained. The singer goes on to discourage use of juju (traditional charms) for whatever reason. He goes on to cite another scenario where a certain guy called Skimbo was deceived by fake herbalists because of his love for money. “On the song, Skimbo in trying to be rich resorted to sangomas in search for a goblin which he bought using his whole herd of cattle. Unfortunately, the sangomas sold him a fake goblin and he lost everything,” he said. The single has brought together sungura lovers in an amazing way with many creating social media groups in trying to reach out to each other in appreciation of the Tonga masterpiece. With the attention and airplay that the song has gained, it can arguably be in the running for song of the year. – @joelTsvakwi
