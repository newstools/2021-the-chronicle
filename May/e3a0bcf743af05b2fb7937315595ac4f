The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter The Caf organising committee for women’s football has postponed the Women Total Caf Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers set for next month citing poor state of stadia in some countries and restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic. In a statement to member associations on Wednesday morning, Caf deputy general secretary for football and development Anthony Bafoe said the decision was also in line with postponement of the men’s World Cup qualifiers last week. “Caf organising committee of women’s football decided to postpone the qualifiers of the women Africa Cup of Nations, Morocco 2022 in line with the postponement of the men World Cup Qualifiers. The reasons of the postponements were based on the actual conditions of certain stadia in Africa and the restrictions related to Covid-19. The first round will now take place in the Fifa window of 18 to 26 October 2021 and the second round will take place in the Fifa window of 14th to 23rd February 2022,” wrote Bafoe. Mighty Warriors coach Sithethelwe ‘Kwinji 15’ Sibanda had already called up a 25-member squad that was expected to go into camp on Thursday to prepare for their first-round match against Eswatini. While the postponement is a minor setback for Sibanda, the move provides her with a chance to have physically fit players by the time qualifiers resume since the local Women’s Super League matches are set to get rolling on June 15.
