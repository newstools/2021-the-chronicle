SOME Highlanders members and supporters met at the club house on Sunday and formed a Greater Bulawayo Supporters Chapter. The meeting was held at the same time and venue with that of the popular Heart and Soul Supporters Chapter. In an interview, interim chairman of the Greater Bulawayo Supporters Chapter Themba Mhlophe said they had the blessings of the club, but club executive committee member Mgcini Mafu chose to attend the Heart and Soul meeting. There are allegations that the Bulawayo Supporters Chapter is a project funded by a losing candidate in the March Highlanders elections, but Mhlophe scoffed at the claims. “We are not someone’s project, but just a group of staunch Highlanders members and supporters, whose interest is to push the Bosso agenda, nothing more, nothing less,” said Mhlophe, a renowned athletics coach and administrator. He said they would soon draft a working document to direct their operations. “Look we formed this chapter after the realisation that we have too many supporters’ chapters in Bulawayo which wasn’t potraying a good picture of this great institution. We believe one united and big chapter in Bulawayo is the way to go. We will soon be rolling out our programmes as a chapter,” said Mhlophe. Two weeks ago, a meeting was held at the club house with the aim of establishing a single supporters’ chapter, but the group failed to reach a consensus on the name, as some felt that Heart and Soul should be the main name, while others, mostly former members of Heart and Soul, said a new name was more appropriate. Mhlophe leads a four-member interim committee and is deputised by Fisinolia Dube, while Pauline Ncube is the interim secretary-general and Never Phiri is the committee member. “We did not elect a treasurer because we are still an interim and are yet to have financial books. In three months when we would have drafted our constitution, we will then choose a treasurer,” said Mhlophe.
