CHIEF Matibe of Beitbridge East will soon send a team to investigate cases of illegal sale of communal land around Ward 5 in Lutumba, Goda, and Mapai areas. It is alleged that some traditional leaders are selling communal land to unscrupulous businessmen for an average of R15 000 per stand. The worst affected areas are Lutumba, Mapai, Mahuhushe and Goda located close to the Beitbridge – Masvingo highway within a radius of 30km from the border town. Chronicle understands that a decision to send the delegation was arrived at during a meeting between traditional leaders and the chief at his Madaulo homestead on Saturday. “I received a report from some members of the community under Headman Tshinoni and after meeting with several traditional leaders under my jurisdiction, we agreed to send a team to investigate the issues before we can make a final determination,” said Chief Matibe. He said the investigating team will comprise traditional leaders from Headman Tshinoni and Headman Tsetana areas. @tupeyo
