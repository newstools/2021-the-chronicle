SONGSTRESS-cum-actress Lee McHoney who rose to prominence last year after featuring on drama series Wadiwa Wepa Moyo that was a hit locally, has promised her fans more great strides in her music and acting career this year. Lee McHoney, who calls herself “Your future baby mama” seems to be on the right track thus far as she recently featured on a track that is on the NetOne One World album alongside Holy Ten, Jah Signal, Allan Chimbetu, Allanah, Tinashe Magacha, John Cole, Mbeu and Pro Beats. For her acting career, Lee McHoney said she is now preparing for the shoot of Wadiwa Wepa Moyo season two. “The year 2021 is destined to be great, for both my acting and music career. As an actress, I’m getting ready for the production of Wadiwa Wepa Moyo season two which is happening really soon. After a long wait, I’m glad our fans will finally get to watch us again. “Musically, I’ve been involved in the NetOne album and this project is also dropping soon with some songs from the album already being released on the One TV channel. Working with all those diverse artistes was awesome and I feel honoured to have worked with some of the most prominent people in the industry. As an artiste from Bulawayo, it meant a lot,” she said. — @mthabisi_mthire
