THE Mighty Warriors are expected to troop into camp in Harare tomorrow to prepare for the upcoming Total Women’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Eswatini next month. The first leg is set for June 7 at the National Sports Stadium, with the return leg a week later. If they sail past Eswatini, coach Sithethelelwe Kwinji 15 Sibanda’s charges will have to contend with either Botswana or Angola in the second and final round in the race for a ticket to the Afcon finals set for Morocco next year. “The team goes into camp on Wednesday and will remain there until match day,” said Zifa communications and competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela. Without doubt, the physical trainer will have a lot to do to bring the players to a certain level of fitness since there has been no active football for more than a year. The Africa Women’s Cup of Nations competition also serves as a qualifier for the Fifa Women’s World Cup Australia-New Zealand 2023.
The Mighty Warriors last qualified for the women’s version of the Africa Cup of Nations in 2016 in Cameroon. They reached the semi-finals in their debut appearance in 2000 and that remains the team’s best performance. Previously, Zimbabwe qualified for the continental stage on three occasions in the formative stages of women’s football in the country in 2000, 2002 and 2004. Coach Sibanda is expected to name her provisional squad today.
