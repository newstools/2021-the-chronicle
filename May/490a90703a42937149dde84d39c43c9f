BULAWAYO will tomorrow hold its belated Culture Week celebrations at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo with the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Judith Ncube being the guest of honour. The celebrations will be held under Covid-19 regulations through an intimate, strictly by invite event. Culture Week was celebrated from May 15 to 22 across the country under the theme: “Resilience in Safeguarding Creativity and Cultural Diversity, as Zimbabwe joined the world in celebrating cultural diversity. At the gallery, there will be performances from Afro-soul songbird Thandi Dhlana, Umkhathi Theatre Works, Thaluso the poet, Sithandazile Dube, visual artiste Marvellous Munashe Chitsa and Maskandi musicians Mkhuphuli and Yellow World. National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) Bulawayo provincial arts manager, Cleopatra Dube said: “Preparations are going well and we as a province, are ready to host the event. The guest of honour is Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Judith Ncube.” Last week, President Emmerson Mnangagwa launched Culture Week celebrations at Chief Njelele’s homestead in Gokwe, Midlands. Government ministers and Zimbabweans at large watched traditional dancers, listened to traditional music with those in attendance sampling traditional cuisine. The concept of Culture Week was drawn from UNESCO’s 2001 Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, which in 2001 proclaimed May 21 as World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development. Last year, Google celebrated Zimbabwe’s national instrument, the mbira, as part of Culture Week, with an interactive Google Doodle video that allowed people around the world to play and learn about the instrument.
