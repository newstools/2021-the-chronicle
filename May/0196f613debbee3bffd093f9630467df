The Chronicle THE Caf football blackout in southern Africa is showing no signs of an end despite the recent appointment of Patrice Motsepe as president of the African football governing body. One of Motsepe’s priorities upon succeeding Ahmad Ahmad in March was to restore Caf inter-club competitions and international African football to Southern African television screens. SuperSport lost its TV rights in November 2019 after the previous Ahmad-led organisation terminated their five-year contract with Lagardère Sports worth a staggering $1 billion. With SuperSport acquiring the broadcasting rights from the French company which held a 12-year association with Caf – the ongoing legal battle has delayed the process of restoring Africa’s elite football competitions to southern African audiences. And Motsepe, speaking at the excecutive committee meeting in Rwanda last week admitted the fact that the previous regime ended their contract without valid reason has brought issues early into his tenure as Caf president. “I have now spent so much time in almost all of those meetings with potential sponsors and partners and with people who we need to work with,” Motsepe said. “And the message I received over and over again is ‘Caf is in court’ because there is a perception that certain agreements, certain contracts, were concluded which were improper, and the people who want to work with us and want to give us more resources are saying: ‘You have got to clean your house’. “Some have even said, ‘We will find ourselves in court if we conclude agreements with you now when there are still these agreements, whether it is TV rights or contracts, which were done in a manner that is improper.’ “I want to indicate to you that we are going to do what is required. I am going to take legal advice and make sure that this organisation is not just protected, but that we get out of those arrangements.” — KickOff
