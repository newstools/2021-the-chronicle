ZIMBABWE Boxing Federation (ZBF) is appealing to the corporate world and well-wishers to assist it raise US$2 000 to send its technical director Stephen Masiyambumbi to a high-level course in Dubai. Masiyambumbi has been shortlisted for a 10-day high-level International Boxing Association (AIBA) 3-Star RJ (referees and judges) course that starts on Friday in Dubai. “This is an elite course that will enable a Zimbabwean official qualify even to officiate in the Olympic Games. Since it’s not an International Olympic Committee event, participants have to pay their own course fees and air fares which add up to about US$2 000. “We’re appealing to the corporate world and well-wishers to help us raise this amount so that the ZBF technical director attends. This is good for the sport of boxing,” said Arvian Mathe, ZBF secretary-general. Masiyambumbi has to leave the country on Thursday to join 26 other participants drawn from Africa, America, Asia and Europe. The participants were selected from the 201 federations affiliated to AIBA. Africa has seven prospective 3-Star RJ officials, Masiyambumbi from Zimbabwe, Zambia’s Darius Kabwe, Godfrey Peircy from Botswana, the Egyptian pair of Mohamed Kamal Abdelsalam and Mostafa Ismail Abbas Abbas, as well as the Tunisian duo of Halmi Sassi and Sarah Bouhlel, who are set to attend the Dubai course. There are two Americans, 11 Asians and seven European participants set for the programme that coincides with the 2021 Asian Elite Men and Women’s Championship in Dubai from May 21 to June 1. Participants will engage in theory sessions on May 22 and 23, followed by a practical evaluation which includes officiating in the 2021 Asian Elite Men and Women Championship from May 24-30. — @ZililoR
