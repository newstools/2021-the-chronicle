The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent The Bulawayo Day and Bulawayo Arts Festival (Baf) which were coined last year to celebrate Bulawayo’s 126 years as a city, will this year go ahead with the dates for the Baf being unveiled.

The Bulawayo Arts Festival went ahead and was staged virtually. <img class="alignnone wp-image-545132 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/asd2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/asd2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/asd2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Bulawayo Day was set aside to commemorate the declaration of the city as a town in 1894 and is supposed to be marked by arts and cultural activities this year. <img class="alignnone wp-image-545135 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/asd3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/asd3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/asd3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bulawayo was declared a town by Dr Leander Starr Jameson on June 1, 1894 and subsequently attained city status in 1943. The city also had its first advisory board in 1894. In 2019, the local authority passed a resolution to have June 1 declared as Bulawayo Day following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with local art and culture organisation, Nhimbe Trust. – @mthabisi_mthire
