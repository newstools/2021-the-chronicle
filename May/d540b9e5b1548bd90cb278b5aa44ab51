SOUTH Africa-based songstress and broadcaster, La Dee, through her humanitarian organisation Zenzele Women’s Organisation which she formed last year, is empowering rural women from Bubi District through agriculture projects. The women from her rural village of Tshayile are operating a fowl run that has close to 1 000 birds that La Dee donated. Speaking from her base in South Africa, La Dee, an afro-pop and dance musician, said the programme, as the word Zenzele means is all about empowering women to be able to fend for themselves. “Zenzele women’s organisation was launched last year in the Bubi district. It’s made up of women aged between 20 and 70. I formed the organisation after realising the need for women’s empowerment, especially in the rural areas,” said La Dee. She said she is also benefiting from interacting with the women as she is learning a lot. “I’m blessed to be working with fellow women because they’re inspiring and teaching me a lot of things, mostly the importance of love and patience,” said La Dee. She said there are plans to venture into bread baking business as the dream is to bring out the good out of the women. “My dream is for the girl child or woman to have a better future. I wish to grow the organisation and expand the project to other districts like Nkayi, Lupane and Kezi among others because it’s not about where we come from but about supporting communities,” said La Dee. — mthabisi_mthire.
