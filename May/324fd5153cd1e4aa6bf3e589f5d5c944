BULAWAYO beauty, Cocoa (real name Ellain Qhawelihle Ncube) has been selected to represent Zimbabwe at the Miss Eloquent Africa pageant that is set to take place in Nigeria in September. The beauty was shortlisted by organisers of the pageant as one of the semi-finalists alongside Harare-based models Nomatter Shamuyarira and Nicole Madimutsa. Following public votes, Cocoa and Madimutsa were selected to represent Zimbabwe. They will now vie for the crown against models from the host Nigeria, Uganda, Ghana and Angola. Cocoa said she is humbled by the support she got from fellow Zimbabweans and beyond in order to represent the country at the finals. “My votes were the highest and I’m very grateful for this support. Following this selection, my target is to proudly represent the country at the finals,” said Cocoa. Cocoa as one of the representatives, will automatically be the pageant’s local licence holder for next year’s Miss Eloquent Africa Zimbabwe pageant. Miss Eloquent Africa is a non-governmental organisation based in Nigeria that seeks to empower young African women using pageantry. It is also a tool to promote African culture and unite Africans. The pageant was set up primarily with the aim to change the perception of how people view the girl child. — @mthabisi_mthire.
