UPCOMING hip hop musician Papi Nala (real name Alan Hlatshwayo) has released an Extended Play (EP) titled The Preamble which reveals the day-to-day happenings of Bulawayo. The EP is available on digital platforms and has six tracks namely Vulan’ndlela, Bulawayo, Blow, Sphatheleni, Witit featuring Payday-Zw and Demi Demi which is an Amapiano song and features Greatjoy Hlats and Renzo Lax. Papi Nala said the EP is an introduction of him in the music industry. “The EP is all about narrating the events that happen in the City of Kings and Queens. The track Sphatheleni shows the hustle side of Bulawayo while Vulan’ndlela asks other artistes to open the way as I’m coming into the industry to make a change. The Amapiano track called Demi Demi basically gives sound to the vibe we have in the city,” said Papi Nala. Papi Nala released his debut single called Unconditinal love in 2016 when he was an Upper Six student at Speciss College. “My music is like therapy as I use it as an outlet to get over anxiety and depression and I feel connected just right after I sing about the day-to-day life problems. I sing to bring hope to the hopeless and to let someone out there know that there is a way to get over obstacles in life,’’ said Papi Nala. The 23-year-old artiste said music is not something new in his life as it runs in his family as his parents have pursued music before. Commenting on his career, Papi Nala said: “I am slowly growing in the industry and I have already performed in South Africa at places like Diepsloot, Alexandra and Soweto.” Papi Nala is also an actor in a film called Tsikamutanda that can be found on YouTube.-@michieroxy.
