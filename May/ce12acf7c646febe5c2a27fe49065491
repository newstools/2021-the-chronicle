ZIMBABWE Cricket (ZC) have confirmed the dates for a five-match 50-over series that will see the Lady Chevrons square off against the South African Emerging side in Bulawayo. In a statement ZC said: “Zimbabwe Women will be back in action next week when they face the South Africa Emerging side. Matches scheduled for 18, 20, 22, 24 and 26 May will be at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo.” A squad of 15 players got into camp in Harare last Wednesday and is fine-tuning at Old Hararians Sports Club prior to shifting to Bulawayo on Saturday. Zimbabwe is preparing for the International Cricket Council Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier scheduled for Sri Lanka in December. The Women’s Cricket World Cup is scheduled to be held in New Zealand in March and April 2022. It was originally scheduled for 6 February to 7 March 2021 but was postponed by one year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Lady Chevrons are also taking part in the ICC Women’s Qualifier Africa to be staged in Botswana in September. The Lady Chevrons were last in action during the Pakistan women tour of Zimbabwe which was called-off after just one match after Emirates Airlines decided to suspend its flight operations on the Harare-Dubai route between February 13 – 28. Pakistan women’s team were forced to fly back home after having won the first ODI. — @innocentskizoe.
