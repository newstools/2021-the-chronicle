ZIMBABWE Cheetahs assistant head coach Graham Kaulback has expressed gratitude to Rugby Africa for giving them an opportunity to compete after a long period of inactivity that stretches over a year. The Cheetahs are part of the Rugby Africa solidarity camp in Stellenbosch, South Africa, as part of preparations for the Tokyo Olympics final qualifying tournament to be held in Monaco, France, in June. Rugby Africa is sponsoring flights, accommodation and coronavirus testing for a delegation of 18. The men’s camp will run from May 6-16 and the teams involved are Zimbabwe, South Africa, Kenya and Uganda. Kaulback said: “This is a huge opportunity for us. Thank you so much to Rugby Africa for giving us a chance to play coming out of a long period of not competing. This is a huge opportunity to play against other African teams in a camp of solidarity and prepare our players for the Olympic Qualifiers in Monaco where we have a last chance to qualify for the Olympics. We are looking forward to a successful camp. We know the competition is going to be good. This is an amazing facility as well.” South Africa and Kenya have qualified for the Tokyo Olympics, while Zimbabwe and Uganda are heading to Monaco for their last opportunity to qualify for the global sporting showpiece on June 19-20. Uganda were beaten in the final by Kenya in the 2019 Rugby Africa Men’s Sevens held in South Africa, while Zimbabwe took bronze in the same event. Cheetahs Squad
