TWO visitors who turned villain and assaulted their host’s neighbour have been jailed nine months for assault. Themba Sibanda (33) and Brighton Tshuma (23) both of Mkhosana suburb in Victoria Falls had visited a house in the city when they assaulted Mr Emmerson Makunze. The incident happened on March 28 when Mr Makunze approached his neighbour around 11pm and asked for a lighter. The neighbour refused to give him the lighter. Sibanda and Tshuma chased him away and he went back to his house. The duo followed Mr Makunze before he could get home and started beating him up. Mr Makunze lost front teeth during the assault. Sibanda and Tshuma used a stick to hit him all over the body. One of them picked a brick and hit him on the head before he collapsed. His wife was helped by a neighbour to carry him home. Sibanda and Tshuma fled from the scene seeing that their victim had fallen unconscious but were later arrested following a report to the police. The two pleaded guilty to a charge of assault when they appeared before Victoria Falls resident magistrate Ms Lindiwe Maphosa. Each was sentenced to nine months in jail before three months were suspended on condition of good behaviour. Each will serve six months in prison. The court was told that Mr Makunze was treated at Victoria Falls Hospital for the injuries he sustained from the attack. Prosecuting, Mr Asher Chindedza said the incident happened at house number 5182 Mkhosana. “The accused had a misunderstanding with the complainant who they were chasing away from their yard before they started assaulting him,” said Mr Chindedza.-@NyikaLingani.
