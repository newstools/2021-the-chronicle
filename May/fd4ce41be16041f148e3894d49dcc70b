The Chronicle Fast-rising DJ Lamiez has opened up about her harrowing experience of being “violated and harassed” by fans on stage at a gig in Zeerust, North West and has asked not to be treated like an object. Taking to Twitter, the star who is married to musician, Khuli Chana said although she was well-versed in the chaos of groove, she could not understand why fans groped her while she was performing. “I’ve had to deal with a lot of chaos at gigs (as patiently as possible) but I need you to help me make sense of someone legit pulling my hair while one or two others touched my bum as security tried to escort me out. In the 11 years that I’ve done this, I have never felt so violated,” said Lamiez. The Pretoria-born star who is a Live AMP presenter on SABC 1 and Metro FM host said even though she loves being one of SA’s hottest DJs, she wants to remind her followers to remember she is human and to respect her boundaries. “Eight bodyguards and yet even that wasn’t enough! I love what I do but I hate what it comes with. People forget that you’re human and instead treat you like an object!” Lamiez wrote. Brought to tears, Lamiez said she was upset thinking about the incident, and pleaded with fans to not treat her like an object. “Went to bed with such a heavy heart. It’s all good now or at least it will be. I need to stop talking about last night because it upsets me so much that I end up crying all over again. Not because I am weak, but because of how angry I actually am! Bottom line, I am not an object!” she said. The incident that occurred this past weekend had fans showing up with their support and outraged by the incident, including transport minister Fikile Mbalula. — TimesLive.
