A painting of Cecil the Lion, which was slain in Hwange by trophy hunters six years ago, sparking outrage worldwide, is going up for auction to help fund conservation efforts in Zimbabwe. Walter Palmer, a dentist and hunter from the United States of America, killed Cecil the Lion outside Zimbabwe’s Hwange National Park in July 2015. The lion’s death sparked outrage around the globe, with conservationists condemning trophy hunting. Bidding has started on the African Bush Camp’s (ABC) website and closes on May 22 at 11.23AM. So far, the highest bid is US$3 000. The painting by John Talbot that will be up for auction, is pegged at US$12 000 and the highest bidder will win two nights for two at Africa Bush Camp’s flagship camp, Somalisa in Hwange national park. There they can admire Cecil’s granddaughters, as well as Humba and Netsai, the reigning male lions. Also, the highest bidder will win a signed copy of the original image of Cecil the Lion by Nic Polenakis. According to ABC’s founder and professional guide, Beks Ndlovu, they were excited to hold this auction. “You might remember Cecil, the beautiful lion we lost six years ago due to illegal hunting? This story moved millions and globally, we raised our collective voice for conservation. “That’s why we are so excited to announce our newest auction to help raise some much-needed funds for the wonderful work being done by our African Bush Camps Foundation teams in Zimbabwe. “Partnering with esteemed artiste, John Talbot and former ABC ambassador, guide training coordinator and photographer, Nic Polenakis, we are offering something unique to hang in your home – an amazing original painting of the famous late patriarch of the Hwange lion pride, Cecil,” said Ndlovu in a statement. <img class="alignnone wp-image-546218 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/cecil-lion.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/cecil-lion.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/cecil-lion-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “What’s more: the highest bidder will also win two nights for two at ABC’s flagship camp, Somalisa. Here, you can admire Cecil’s granddaughters, as well as Humba and Netsai, the reigning male lions.” Ndlovu said due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a decline in the revenue they could channel into conservation and they had to think of innovative ways to raise money. “Our foundation is partially funded by a percentage of all revenue generated by visitors to the African Bush Camps properties; however, the pandemic has meant a devastating decline in safari tourism and, subsequently, a reduction in the funds that help your support go further each year. Adaptability is the theme of this time, which is why we are getting creative to raise funds,” said Ndlovu. Palmer, an American dentist and recreational game hunter from Minnesota, reportedly paid US$50 000 to a professional hunter and guide, Theo Bronkhorst in Gwayi Conservancy, to enable him to kill a lion. Cecil was allegedly lured out of the sanctuary where he was shot and wounded with an arrow from a crossbow. He was subsequently tracked down, some hours later was killed with a rifle. Cecil was then skinned and his head was removed. When his headless skeleton was found by park investigators, his tracking collar was missing. The killing drew international media attention and sparked outrage among animal conservationists, politicians and celebrities, as well as a strong negative internet response against Palmer, who went into hiding.- Follow on Twitter @bonganinkunzi
