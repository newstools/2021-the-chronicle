The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Women’s Soccer League (ZWSL) executive is finalising logistics on how to conduct mandatory Covid-19 tests with a section of its top tier teams ahead of the start of the season next month. The season kick-off date has tentatively been set for June 19 and Covid-19 tests are part of the standard operating procedures that national sports associations have to follow to restart any form of activity, whether it be competition or just training. “We are in the process of finalising Covid-19 testing with clubs so that by the time the league resumes on the 19th of June all players and officials would have been tested,” said ZWSL boss Barbara Chikosi. She said some clubs had already tested their players and started training in readiness for the season kick-off.
Zifa will meet full costs of the Covid-19 testing for all 16 Super League teams. Besides meeting the testing costs, Zifa will also provide each participating team with two sets of playing kit, 30 soccer balls as well as transport to and from matches; which is a first for domestic women’s football. The imminent return of competitive women’s football will bring joy to the Mighty Warriors coaches, who had faced the prospects of plunging into the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers with players in bad physical shape after more than a year of inactivity. Their qualifier against Eswatini together with all other matches schedlued for next month were postponed by Caf to the last week of October due to the Covid-19 crisis and stadia that do not meet required international standards. The matches will now be held between October 18 and 26. Zimbabwe Women’s Super League teams: Black Rhinos, Blue Swallows, Harare City, Hearts of Oak, Weerams, Conduit Soccer Academy, Correctional Services, Black Mambas, Midlands State University, Auckland, Faith Drive, Ngezi Scorpions Queens, ZRP Harare, Cyclone Stars, Herentals and ZRP Queens
