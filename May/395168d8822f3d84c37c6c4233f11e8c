The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) Bulawayo province has begun staging friendly matches as it gears towards full resumption of activities. Provincial chairman Joseph Nkomazana said resumption of games had been delayed owing to lack of sponsorship for the provincial leagues. “We are set to have an executive meeting as a province as we continue with plans to fully return to the court. The biggest challenge at the moment is that we need to get sponsorship, which is hard to find,” said Nkomazana. “The teams are also doing their part to  prepare by organising some friendly games, which are being played under strict Covid-19 rules.” The province is also in the process of inviting clubs that want to play in the Division Two league to register with the association. Zina had at the beginning of last year put in place plans to introduce a Division Two league to feature teams from Bulawayo before sport was frozen by the Covid-19 enforced lockdown. – @innocentskizoe
