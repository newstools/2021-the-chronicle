A BULAWAYO-based film production company, Emex Media is working on
a movie titled Who will save us? that seeks to unpack social ills. Munyaradzi Maguwa, an up-and-coming artist who runs Emex Media,
said the movie, his first production, will introduce to the world, the immense talent that is in Bulawayo’s ghettos. He said the forthcoming movie will unpack the social injustices
which have found their way in societies. “The movie, Who will save us? is an outcry by a community that is plunged into misery due to situations taking place in the society where young people have turned to drug abusers, thieves, women abusers and murderers. “The idea is to explore and expose the city’s talent through this film,” said Maguwa. Maguwa who is doubling as an actor and director said he is grateful to Edwin Phiri who produced the movie’s trailer, as he has been mentoring him in the film field. He said if well supported, the production can meet international standards, something that will easily boost the country’s film industry. “For now, we’re sourcing funds to ensure that our movie meets global standards. If we get sponsorship, I’m confident that we’ll be able to transform our local content to be globally competitive just like South African productions like Queen Sono and Seriously single among others. “My dream is to unlock the giant that has been kept silent in Zimbabwe’s
film industry as there’s a lot of talent lying idle. Through our quality works, I also want to debunk the myth that one has to go out of the country to succeed
as an actor or film writer.” -@mthabisi_mthire.
