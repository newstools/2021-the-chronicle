ZIFA has said it will pay for all Covid-19 tests for players in the lower division leagues. There had been concern that the national association was backtracking on its earlier promise to meet costs of the tests using Fifa Covid-19 relief funds. Zifa communications and competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela said they had put aside a portion of the Fifa Covid-19 relief funds for lower league teams after disbursing the Premier Soccer League and women’s football share last year. “We received a total of $1,8 million from Fifa and Caf as follows: US$1 million from Fifa, US$500 000 for women from Fifa and US$300 000 from Caf. “We made public the distribution and never diverted anything. “PSL got theirs last year for tests and what we have now is for regions, provinces and affiliates as in the distribution list,” said Gwesela. Meanwhile, Zifa has started registering players that are out of contract following concerns that some clubs were refusing to issue clearance letters demanding that they be paid compensation fees first. “In the interest of all parties and football progress and to avert potential crisis, Zifa has taken a decision to immediately register all affected players with clubs of their choice so that they can play football, while whoever is aggrieved can pursue recourse through proper dispute handling procedures available in our football statutes. “Zifa would like to reiterate that it is not at all ruling on the status of the affected players, but the association is ensuring that player careers are not jeopardised while a dispute is ensuing,” said Zifa in a letter to the PSL yesterday. “By copy of this letter, the Premier Soccer League secretariat is hereby ordered to immediately facilitate that all affected players are registered with clubs of their choice,” reads the Zifa letter.
