ZIMBABWE international striker Tinotenda Kadewere’s side Lyon missed out on a Champions League slot following a 2-3 defeat to ninth-placed Nice on Sunday night. With Ligue 1 champions Lille and PSG claiming the two tickets for the premier European club tournament, Monaco, who finished third with 78 points, two clear of Lyon, will compete in the Champions League play-offs. Victory for Lyon on the final day would have propelled them into third, since Monaco had played to a goalless draw with Lens. Kadewere, who missed his side’s last two matches due to a muscle injury, will now compete in the less prestigious Uefa Europa Cup. The Zimbabwean striker, who started his debut Ligue 1 season on fire, scoring seven goals between October and December, was affected by injuries towards the end of the season, scoring only three goals to finish the season on 10 goals. The former Harare City star weighed in with three assists in 33 matches this season for Lyon. Meanwhile, Zimbabwean midfielder Marshal Munetsi, who also plies his trade in the French top tier, was not included in the Reims match day squad for the last match of the season. Reims lost that match 1-0 to Bordeaux to finish in 14th place. — @ZililoR
