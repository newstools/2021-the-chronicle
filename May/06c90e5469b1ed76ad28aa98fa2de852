The Chronicle CAPE TOWN — After the PSL’s Executive Committee issued a media statement on Friday afternoon, the stage is set for another Premier Soccer League (PSL) boardroom battle to decide the GladAfrica Championship title race and subsequent Premiership promotion. On Wednesday, the PSL disciplinary committee awarded Sekhukhune United three points after Polokwane City were found guilty of contravening the rules of the GladAfrica Championship. They failed to include five Under-23 players on their team sheet against Sekhukhune earlier this year in January. Usually, the PSL would regard the findings of its disciplinary committee as final and binding, so it came as a surprise when on Friday it announced that “it is the view of the League (PSL) that it is not correct”. It is hard to believe that the executive committee will attempt to undermine the independence of their judicial tribunal by offering a different view on the matter. — iol
