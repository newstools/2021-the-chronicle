So when fast-rising Bulawayo fashionista, Brilliantine Bangamuseve rocked a cowhide outfit this week in celebration of her birthday, she owned the social media streets as she screamed royalty and presented all the qualities of a feisty African queen. <img class="alignnone wp-image-545380 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Bulawayo-fashionista5-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Bulawayo-fashionista5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Bulawayo-fashionista5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The outfit was a result of a partnership between local designers, Nomakhosazana Ncube’s A Tribe Called Zimbabwe (brand whose thrust is to celebrate Zimbabwean heritage and identity through fashion) and Freddy Sozinio Jackson’s Sozinio (a brand that embodies the words couture, high fashion, style and glamour), both Bulawayo brands. <img class="alignnone wp-image-545382 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Bulawayo-fashionista6-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Bulawayo-fashionista6.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Bulawayo-fashionista6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The result was magical.
