BREAKOUT musician Tebza says he has been juggling school work and coming up with new music as he is preparing for O-level exams that he is due to sit for later this year. In trying to remain relevant in the music scene, Tebza recently teamed up with experienced rapper Asaph and Fish S McSwagg for a new track titled Into Yethu. The hip-hop track that was released on Tebza’s YouTube page over the weekend was also the young artiste’s way to show people that he is not a one-dimensional artiste who only produces kwaito tracks. The song will hopefully surpass his 2020 hit, President Yama2k that is popular not only locally but regionally as the song’s video is being played on platforms like Channel O. The world was introduced to Tebza during an electrifying performance at the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards two years ago when he sang the gqom song Waz’khothilihlo. Tebza, a Form Four pupil at Milton High School in Bulawayo, has since then been working hard to make the grade. “This year I’m writing my O-level exams so I’ve been concentrating on my school work since I returned from South Africa. I want to pass my O-levels and go to the next stage. I have been trying to juggle school work and my music career,” said Tebza. In order to remain relevant in the music scene, Tebza said he decided to join forces with Asaph and Fish S McSwagg for his new track. “The track is about drip (looking cool and having swag). I thought of doing something different from amapiano as I want to show people that I’m not an amapiano or kwaito artiste. I’m a musician who does any kind of music,” said Tebza. The year started off great for Tebza as he was nominated in the Best Dance house/kwaito category at the Zimbabwe Music Awards. Although he did not win, he has been working hard to build a name for himself following the Best Newcomer gong that he won at the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards last year.
