FORMER Highlanders coach Amini Soma-Phiri has been praised for his role in the revival of Zimbabwe Saints. Saints, who were formed in 1931, five years after the establishment of Highlanders, are on a revival path after hovering on the brink of defunction for the past six years. Chikwata, as Saints are affectionately known, secured a franchise in the Zifa Southern Region Division One League last year after clearing debts in excess of US$5 000 owed to Zifa backdated to 2014. Last Friday, Chikwata launched a road map for their return to the Premier Soccer League, with the hope of conquering the First Division. Allaying fears of failing to meet the May 31 player registration deadline, Saints board of trustees chairman Vincent Pamire said they had relied on a “football person”, Soma-Phiri, to assist them recruit the right calibre of players. Soma-Phiri runs a developmental side called Luveve Big XI, a club that produced the likes of former Warriors’ player Milton Ncube and ex-Bosso right-back Atlast Musasa, who is now based in Namibia. “Lloyd Munhanga has offered a lot. Having seen his passion to keep the Zimbabwe Saints name alive, we took him on board with his players. Even Homela (Gibson) went around looking for players and roped in other people to assist with the recruitment exercise. It is not Highlanders people that they looked for, but football people like Amini Soma-Phiri, who heard our cries to revive Saints, and helped us,” said Pamire. Saints have to contend with the likes of Talen Vision and former Premiership side Hwange, who are both serious contenders for the Division One league title. Vision have been on a recruitment drive, attracting experienced players like Mkhokheli Dube, Zephaniah Ngodzo, Obidiah Tarumbwa and Mengezi Dube, among other players, while Hwange are also aiming for a quick return to the topflight. — @ZililoR
