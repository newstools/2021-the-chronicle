Geraldine Roche Drama was established as a medium to reach into the community to aid and educate people on social issues and entertain at the same time. The programme uses drama and film production to deliver messages and education around various subjects of social advocacy. Concurrently it helps develop the talent and aspirations of young people. – @mthabisi_mthire
