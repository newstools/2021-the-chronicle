THE Zimbabwe Junior Sables return to competitive action this week to face Zambia and Namibia in a series of matches for the first time since the suspension of sport was lifted. The national Under-20 side will be away to Zambia on Saturday before hosting the same opponents a week later in Harare and travel to Namibia for two matches on June 16 and 19. Junior Sables captain Jason Makwabarara said they had initially started training in November last year only to be stopped in January when Covid-19 cases soared. “We have a good squad and everyone is excited to be playing rugby again. It’s an honour to be playing for this side as we continue working to become professional players,” said Makwabarara. His deputy, Carlos Matematema, said: “It’s been a long journey for me and I’ve worked hard to be up here, and it’s all thanks to the coaches and scouts. I am very honoured to play for the junior national team and am hoping to make it to the senior national team.” Zimbabwe last featured in the second tier World Rugby Under-20 championships when the country hosted the tournament in 2016.
Before that, the Junior Sables had qualified for three successive editions of the competition from 2010-2012.
