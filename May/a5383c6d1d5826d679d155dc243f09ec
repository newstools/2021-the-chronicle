POLICE in Matabeleland North are hunting for robbers who raided a homestead in Inyathi, Bubi District, armed with iron bars and machetes which they used to assault the occupant before making away with $200 000 cash and cellphones worth over $50 000. The incident occurred at Mr Atheranxious Ndlovu’s homestead on May 23 at around 11PM at Matshalini Mine in the Turk Mine area.
Matabeleland North police spokesperson Inspector Glory Banda appealed to anyone with information on the suspects to report to the nearest police station. He said the machete gang used an unknown object to forcibly open the door before gaining entry into the house. To induce fear, one of the suspects hit Mr Ndlovu on the leg and he fell. Insp Banda also said they started demanding cash and other valuables. The accused persons ransacked the house and got away with cell phones and cash. Mr Ndlovu sustained a fractured right leg and was treated at Mpilo Central Hospital. “I can confirm that on 23 May 2021 shortly before midnight at Matshalini mine in Turk Mine area unknown robbers armed with iron bars and machetes pounced on Mr Atheranxious Ndlovu, struck him on the leg before he fell down yelling for help. They searched the house and took away $200 000 cash and cellphones worth $50 000,” said Insp Banda. “We are appealing to anyone with information about the unknown robbers to file a report at any nearest police station. We also advise members of the public to desist from keeping large amounts of cash at home,” said Insp Banda.-@waydenaido.
