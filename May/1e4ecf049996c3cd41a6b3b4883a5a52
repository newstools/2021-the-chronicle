Ccubicky started doing music in 2016 and has worked with the likes of Cliff Jeans and Dray. “I started doing music in 2016 when I was at High School (Mavela Secondary School). My first recording of the single Balling Hard featuring Dray which was produced by Cliff Jeans was in 2019. “Last year, I was supposed to work on something with Cal Vin but unfortunately my nigga died. On March 25 this year, I managed to release another single titled Die Young which is now available on all music platforms,” said Ccubicky. – @mthabisi_mthire
