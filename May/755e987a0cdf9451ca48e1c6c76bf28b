THE 2020 Grade Seven pass rate for Bulawayo City Council-run schools went down and the least performing school was Aisleby which had no learners passing all the five examinable subjects. Of the 29 primary schools, Malindela in Pumula North was the best performing school with a pass rate of 81,8 percent. Ndebele was performed well by learners with a pass rate of 83,77 percent although this was lower than 2019’s 92,46 percent
The English paper was also fairly performed with 78,79 percent of learners passing it. General Paper on the other hand had a pass rate of 75,55 percent and Agriculture 67,04 percent pass rate. Mathematics was a challenge for most learners but the schools recorded a 57,12 percent pass rate. The latest council minutes show that the Covid-19 outbreak heavily impacted the operations of the schools and contributed to the decreasing pass rate. “Indeed, 2020 was a difficult year for all sectors in the country including the education sector because of the outbreak of the corona virus in December 2019 and the announcement of the first national lockdown in March 2020. Effectively, this meant that there was no effective teaching and learning in the year 2020 and this consequently reflected on the results produced by learners,” read the minutes. “It will be recalled that the Government considered units 1-6 as a pass while Council considered units 1-5 as a pass. The National Pass Rate for 2020 Grade Seven (7) examinations went down from 46,99 percent to 37,11 percent and Council schools were similarly affected.” There were 10 schools that scored pass rates below 50 according to the council scale while as per Government scale these were only three. “Malindela topped all the 29 City of Bulawayo primary schools with 81,82 percent pass rate and in second position was Ntshamathe with a 75,97 percent pass rate. JW Mthimkhulu was in third position with a 71,18 percent pass rate, Mgiqika came in the fourth position with a 61,54 percent pass rate and Mahatshula tumbled from first position in 2019 to fifth position garnering only 61,16 percent pass rate. The least performing school was Aisleby which had no learners passing all the five examinable subjects with aggregate 1,” read the minutes. St Peter’s on the other hand recorded a 13.56 percent pass rate second from the bottom and Manondwane had a 31,13 percent pass becoming third from bottom. “Malindela was the most improved with an 11,75 percent increase up from 2019’s 70 percent pass rate. Aisleby was the least performing school in 2020 with no pupils passing all five subjects.” Council said some of the schools’ pass rates dropped significantly, especially Ingubo which went from 75 percent pass rate in 2019 to 38,74 percent in 2020. “Manondwane also recorded a decrease from 60,94 percent pass rate in 2019 to 31,13 percent in 2020. Senzangakhona had the highest number of learners scoring five units, followed by Mawaba Tategulu and Mahlathini had five learners who scored five units,” read the minutes. Council extended its gratitude and appreciation to the school heads, teachers, parents and learners for doing their best under difficult conditions and producing some good results in the process. — @thamamoe.
