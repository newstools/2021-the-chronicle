The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Commissioner-General of Police half marathon will now be held in different towns around the country to enable citizens to interact with the police hierarchy in a sporting environment. Until this year when the road race was staged in Bulawayo on Saturday, previous events have exclusively been held in Harare. Police Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga said they had taken this deliberate step to foster and strengthen social cohesion and alliances through such events to be better positioned in the fight against crime. “A society that has closely knit interactions is better placed to combat all forms of crime,” said Matanga. He also urged people to remain vigilant since the Covid-19 pandemic was not yet over. “As we all know, the past period has not been favourable for gatherings such as this one due to the Covid-19 containment measures, hence we could not hold this event in 2020. We are grateful to the authorities for allowing the 2021 edition of the Commissioner General of Police’s 21 km road race to take place. We remain alive to the fact that as a nation and as society, we are not yet out of the woods. “The third wave is menacing on the horizon with some nations recording alarming new infections and fatalities. We therefore only but religiously adhere to Covid-19 guidelines and wherever possible encourage one another to receive the Covid-19 vaccines so that we robustly hedge our immunity. Above all, let us all continue to sanitise and maintain social distancing,” he said. Saturday’s event was hosted by Bulawayo Athletics Board at the Old Mutual Nkulumane Shopping complex. Zimbabwe Republic Police’s Olivia Chitate won the race in 1 hour 16.57 minutes, while in the men’s category was won by Moses Tarakinyu of Black Rhinos, who clocked 1 hour 04.42 minutes. The two each pocketed $30 000. – @innocentskizoe
