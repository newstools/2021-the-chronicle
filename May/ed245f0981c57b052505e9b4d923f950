POLICE should descend heavily on people that violate natural resources management laws as they cause irreversible damage that threatens food security for future generations, the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Ruth Maboyi has said. Speaking during an event to mark the International Day for Biodiversity that is marked on May 22 at Mtangamutshena Primary School in Beitbridge West on Saturday, Cde Maboyi who is also the Member of Parliament for the constituency raised concern over rampant land degradation. She urged communities to jealously guard their natural resources as they were their source of livelihood. The event was held under the theme “We are part of the solution.” “I’m concerned by the activities I see each day which are a violation of environmental laws. There are illegal mining activities along rivers such as Umzingwane River which disturbs flow of water. There is also indiscriminate cutting down of mopani trees which are crucial in the production of mopani worms which are a source of food and livelihood for the Beitbridge Community and other districts in the province. “There is need for the police to assist environmental entities in controlling the cutting down of trees and other environmental crimes. I urge you as the community to stop cutting mopani trees as they promote production of mopani worms which are important to your livelihoods,” she said. Cde Maboyi said local leadership should play a big role in safeguarding natural resources within the community. She urged the Forestry Commission and other environmental players to educate communities on the dangers of destroying the environment. Forestry Commission provincial manager for Matabeleland South, Mr Bekezela Tshuma said they remained committed to preserving and conserving forests.-@DubeMatutu
