The Minister of State Security Cde Owen Ncube was also wearing a shirt made from the national dress fabric.  The President launched the National Dress Fabric at a colourful event at State House last December, marking the first time that the country has been able to settle on a national dress style since 1980. First Lady Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa spearheaded the search for the National Dress Fabric after embarking on comprehensive consultations with different stakeholders and ethnic groups from all the country’s 10 provinces. <img class="alignnone wp-image-547877 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-55.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-55.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-55-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Yesterday, Chief Njelele’s homestead was the place to be as people gathered to commemorate the national culture week. The event which was this year hosted by the Midlands province was graced by President Mnangagwa. The usually quiet and sleepy Gokwe town was a hive of activity since Thursday when people started gathering in preparation for the event at the Chief’s homestead. <img class="alignnone wp-image-547881 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-56.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-56.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-56-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> By 7.30AM yesterday, police were already directing traffic from Gokwe town centre to Chief Njelele’s homestead, some 10km away.
At the venue, the crowd that kept swelling with time was treated to captivating entertainment from various musicians including Skido from Gweru. Senior Government officials started arriving at the venue at around 9AM with the President arriving at exactly 10.40AM sending the crowd into delirium. President Mnangagwa then toured the exhibition where scores of artistes were showcasing their wares and traditional food.  Addressing the artistes, traditional leaders and Government officials, President Mnangagwa said he felt good for having decided to dress in a shirt made from the national dress fabric. <img class="alignnone wp-image-547882 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-57.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-57.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-57-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “When I arrived and as I was walking, I really felt good, I felt you people looking at me and I know I am smart. We should be wearing dresses and shirts made from the national dress fabric. Some people were looking at me and I felt like a young boy,” he said amid wild cheers. He said soon the national dress fabric will be available across the country. President Mnangagwa said people should be proud of their culture adding that Zimbabwe is a diverse country. <img class="alignnone wp-image-547887 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-59.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-59.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-59-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “As I walked around the exhibition stands, I saw a lot of things which fascinated me. Like a coat made from tree buck fibre,” he said.  One of the exhibitors from Gokwe town, Mrs Eunice Mhlanga said she was exhibiting traditional food after learning to prepare it from one of the classes she attended that was hosted by Amai Mnangagwa. She said she was now serving well prepared traditional food in Gokwe town. <img class="alignnone wp-image-547884 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-58.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-58.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-58-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I appreciate this day for culture. I’m also grateful to Amai Mnangagwa who taught me how to prepare sadza nemuriwo unedovi among other traditional food,” she said. Chief Njelele said his wife is now an excellent cook after attending Amai Mnangagwa’s cooking lessons.
