The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter WARRIORS defender Teenage Hadebe is on the verge of joining Major League Soccer side Houston Dynamo, according to BeIN Sports Turkey. The outlet reported that Hadebe had agreed a deal in principle to move to the United States outfit, which is currently in fourth place in the Western Conference. South African publication Kick Off reported that the deal could be worth more than R25 million. Hadebe recently completed his second season in Turkey after joining Malatyaspor from South African Premiership side Kaizer Chiefs in the 2019/20 season. Malatyaspor finished the season in 15th place with 45 points, 39 points behind champions Besiktas, who beat Galatasaray to the title due to a superior goal difference. Hadebe ended the season with two goals; his first coming last month in his sideâ€™s 1-0 win over Alanyaspor. Should the deal go through, it would be a departure from his expressed desire to play in the English Premiership where his friend Marvelous Nakamba turns out for Aston Villa.
