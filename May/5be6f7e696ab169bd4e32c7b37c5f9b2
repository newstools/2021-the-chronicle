The Chronicle Kent have signed batsman Tawanda Muyeye on a three-year contract. The 20-year-old is the reigning Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year, following in the footsteps of James Taylor, Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler and new teammate Daniel Bell-Drummond. Born in Zimbabwe and a product of Eastbourne College, where he has been coached by former Kent players Rob Ferley and James Tredwell, he qualifies as a domestic player. He won the prestigious Wisden prize on the back of a season that featured 1,112 runs and 56 sixes, both school records. Kent director of cricket Paul Downton said: “We are really excited that Tawanda has agreed to join us at Kent. He had several offers from other counties and was in high demand. “As he begins his journey as a professional cricketer we aim to help him develop as a person and as a cricketer, and to help him fulfil the huge potential he undoubtedly possesses.” Speaking to The Cricketer last year, Muyeye explained: “I grew up on a farm and my brother got me into cricket because he always made me throw balls at him. I played for my provincial team and captained Zimbabwe at U13 and U16 level but I have always wanted to play county cricket. “I want to play for England, but I also want to play in the IPL and the Big Bash.” – The Cricketer
