The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent A COLLEN Bawn mine worker died after he fell into a 100-metre-deep shaft, the second death at a mine in a week. Matabeleland South acting provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Thabani Mkhwananzi confirmed the incident which occurred on Thursday at around 4PM at Bucks Mine in Collen Bawn. He said Edward Mpofu (25) from Nkayi fell down the shaft after a rope his workmates were using to pull him got tangled up with a log. “I can confirm that we recorded a mine accident which occurred at Bucks Mine in Collen Bawn. Edward Mpofu was working in a shaft with other mine workers. After they were done, they used a rope which was attached to a log to exit the shaft,” he said. “When it was Mpofu’s turn to be pulled out of the mine the rope got tangled up around the log and Mpofu fell into the shaft. His workmates retrieved Mpofu’s body out of the shaft but he was already dead. The matter was reported to the police who attended the scene and Mpofu’s body was taken to Gwanda Provincial Hospital Mortuary.” Asst Insp Mkhwananzi urged mine owners to ensure that their workers operated from same environments in order to avoid loss of life. He said workers were also supposed to operate with protective clothing and proper equipment. He said the province continues to record a number of fatal mine accidents and most were being as a result of negligence. “This is the second fatal mine accident which we have recorded within a week which is a cause for concern. Mine owners must ensure that their workers have proper mining equipment, protective clothing and work from safe environments. Mine owners shouldn’t only focus on getting income but they must also invest in their safety of their workers. “People should also desist from engaging in illegal mine activities as they will be putting their lives at risk,” he said. – @DubeMatutu
