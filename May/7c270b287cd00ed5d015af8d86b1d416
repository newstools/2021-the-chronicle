The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba in Gweru
FORMER Dynamos striker King Nasama hopes to revive his career at Wha Wha where he will lead the frontline in the Chibuku Super Cup that gets underway today. Wha Wha mark their return to the Premier Soccer League with a tough assignment against FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium in Zvishavane. Nasama had an unfruitful stint with Chicken Inn in the 2019 season and Wha Wha coach Luke Petros-Jukulile has therefore bestowed faith in the Dynamos’ juniors’ product. “For me this is a rebirth, it’s a season that I hope to bring back flashes of my old self. I am hoping for a good season for myself and the whole team,” Nasama said. “We are in a tough group and we can easily be called minnows but we hope to do well. After my time at Dynamos, I was affected by injuries, but I hope to remain fit for the rest of the season.” Last time out the prison wardens were relegated after one season while under the tutelage of Lloyd Mutasa. Petros-Jukulile is in charge of the team for the first time and although he has no Caf A licence required to coach in the PSL, Zifa has granted him a special waiver to sit on the technical bench and he wants to prove his worth. “I feel this is the year the nation must see that I am a good coach after doing well as a player. The target is to ensure we play toe to toe with the so-called big boys in the league. We hope to win and be recognised,” Petros-Jukulile said. Gweru businessman Enos Size, who together with other businesspeople paid Whawha’s affiliation fees, yesterday pledged to avail US$150 every month for the club’s player of the month award. “In support of the players that have been hard hit by the Covid-19 induced lockdown, every month the player of the month will be getting US$150. I am starting with the match against FC Platinum on Saturday,” Size said.
