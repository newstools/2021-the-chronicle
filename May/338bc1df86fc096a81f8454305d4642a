Through this film that uses Ndebele, Shona, Tonga and English, we want to preach the gospel through film as the storyline is based on a young man coming from overseas to preach the gospel to his relatives in Africa,” said Zambuko. <img class="alignnone wp-image-544900 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/kqq1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/kqq1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/kqq1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said it took them almost four months to come up with the full production whose cast comprises young up-and-coming actors, musicians and comedians from Victoria Falls. “We took two months rehearsing and one-month shooting and another editing.
