The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Chronicle Correspondent DIASPORANS, local villagers from Bulilima West constituency, Matabeleland South province and their legislator have pooled resources to construct a clinic at Tjehanga village. Communities at Tjehanga travel for more than ten kilometres to access the nearby health centres. The long distance has also overwhelmed village health workers when they conduct routine checks in the area. Diasporas who hail from villages surrounding Tjehanga bought building material for the construction of the clinic. On Saturday and Sunday villagers constructed the slab for the clinic. <img class="wp-image-548344 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Bulilima-clinic-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Bulilima-clinic-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Bulilima-clinic-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tjehanga villagers in Bulilima West constituency with legislator Cde Dingumuzi Phuti (in white dust coat) construct a slab for Tjehanga Clinic Zanu-PF Bulilima West legislator Cde Dingumuzi Phuti who is also the Deputy Minister of Information Communication Technologies, Postal and Courier Services and Bulilima proportional representative Dr Evelyn Ndlovu who is also the Minister of State in Vice President Dr Constantino Chiwenga’s Office joined the villagers in the construction of the slab.

Cde Phuti said his role as a legislator is give Government directive thereby achieving President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s Vision 2030 and also achieve the National Development Strategy (NDS1:2021-2025) blueprint. He thanked the continued support from the diaspora and locals in ensuring that they play a role in developing their areas. “We have united as a community from the youth, women, men, traditional leadership and the diaspora to take upon us to construct the clinic that we hope will be operational by sometime next year. The community should be praised for this development.  “The completion is an achievement to NDS1 which states that health is a fundamental human right in terms of the Constitution of Zimbabwe, hence the overall outcome of the Health sector during the NDS1 Period is to improve quality of life. “Through the blueprint Government will implement strategies to achieve improved funding for health during the NDS1 Period and thus is seen with the harmonising of the fragmented health funding pools,” said Cde Phuti.
