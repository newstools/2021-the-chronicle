MORE than 100 people drawn from MDC- Alliance and Mthwakazi Republic Party (MRP), including a former legislator on Saturday defected to Zanu-PF in Hwange district saying they wanted to work with a party that is pro-people and development. The ruling party’s Hwange District Coordinating Committee (DCC) held a meeting at Chinotimba Hall on Saturday where defectors were welcomed by scores of party supporters. One of the defectors who is one of the MDC -T founding members and former MP for Hwange West Mr Peter Nyoni said he lost faith in the party when its president Morgan Tsvangirai died and has been contemplating joining Zanu-PF since then. Scores of excited party supporters and representatives of other political parties as well as Victoria Falls City council, Hwange Local Board and Hwange Rural District Council representatives among other stakeholders attended the DCC meeting. The DCC chairman Cde Mathew Muleya invited the new members to rise and be introduced to the party prompting the supporters to erupt in song and dance. Most of the defectors were youths and Cde Muleya challenged the party’s Youth League to come up with empowerment programmes for young people so that they participate in the country’s economic development. In his address, Cde Muleya called for unity of purpose especially in local authorities saying people want service delivery that can improve their livelihoods. “We represent people and we will do what people want. When we talk about development as Zanu-PF people should see it on the ground. “I feel proud when people join Zanu-PF like this. It’s now up to us to work hard especially the local authorities to make sure people are happy so that many more join us,” he said. Mr Nyoni said all his family members had joined Zanu-PF. He commended Zanu-PF for its developmental policies meant to move the country forward.
