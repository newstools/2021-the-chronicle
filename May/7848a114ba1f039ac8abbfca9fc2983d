FROM a struggling vendor to an owner of a market place in Gwanda CBD, Ms Previous Dizha’s hard work and dedication has made her a successful businesswoman.
Her story may inspire aspiring business people who think they have too little to achieve their dreams. Ms Dizha literally started from rock bottom, gathering experience and utilising every opportunity that came her way. She utilised a small loan to launch herself into bigger business. Ms Dizha, who runs Star Fruit and Veges’ Market together with her husband, said this was just the start of more great business ventures. Her journey as a businesswoman started 20 years ago when she used to sell bread from her home in Bulawayo. “My first business venture was selling bread. I would go to town and buy bread from Downings (Bakery) and I would sell it from my home in Magwegwe West. At that time bread was in short supply and I identified a business opportunity and made use of it. “From there I went into the business of selling mopane worms. I would go to my rural home to get maize and then I would take it to Gwanda or Plumtree and exchange for amacimbi (mopane worms) which I would sell in different places. At that time my husband was still working so I was mainly doing the business alone but he was assisting me wherever he could,” she said. Ms Dizha said she moved to Gwanda where she started vending in the CBD and her husband joined her in the business. She said at the same time she used to buy amacimbi in Gwanda which she sold in Harare. Ms Dizha said in 2018 she received a loan through the Zimbabwe Women’s Microfinance Bank and used the money to buy amacimbi in bulk and stocked them in her house. “I knew that the loan I received was an opportunity for my breakthrough. I bought amacimbi in bulk and sold them in Harare. I took the money I got and opened a farm produce market. I paid rent for the shop and also bought my stock. “When I was a vendor, I had limited stock but now I have a wide variety of products. My place is always busy. Some customers buy in bulk. I now have a wide variety of farm produce, amatemba, sweeping brooms, torches and batteries among other products,” she said. Ms Dizha said she and her husband were in the process of building a grocery store and bottle store in Ntalale area in Gwanda. She said they saved up money from their business and managed to buy a three-tonne truck which they were using in the business. Ms Dizha said they were also building a house in Bulawayo which was almost complete. She said she and her husband had put their four children through school using the money they got from their business. “When I started operating as a vendor, I told myself that I didn’t want to remain at that level forever. The loan I got really helped me a lot. It’s unfortunate that some of my fellow business colleagues after receiving loans divert the funds instead of investing the money in their business which is wrong. When I received that money, I told myself that it will serve its intended purpose,” she said. Ms Dizha said her wish was to open a grocery shop in the CBD which she could operate alongside the market. Her husband, Mr Erias Chapfuwa said he started assisting his wife with her business in 2007 while he was working. Mr Chapfuwa said he was retrenched from work in 2013 and that was when he joined his wife in their business full time. <img class="alignnone wp-image-549154 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-8-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-8-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-8-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said when his wife started her first business venture of selling bread, he never discouraged her efforts. “My wife has always been business oriented and I have given her support from the beginning. At first, I was assisting her with advice until I joined her and we are now running our business together. She is the one who has been in the forefront and I have been with her all the way. I decided to join her in business after I got retrenched from work. “When my wife was a vendor, I was with her because I could see that the vision she had was a reality and I could see that she had a passion for business. Working together we have managed to ensure that we have a decent living and that we are able to fend for our children,” he said.-@DubeMatutu
