The incident happened last week Monday at around 5.30 am. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the Mazda BT50 twin cab registration Number ADV 1118 with three people on board collided with the haulage truck registration number AEZ 8131 Scania heading to Victoria Falls. He said the Mazda BT50 driver was driving on the wrong side of the road when the truck driver tried to warn him by flashing lights, but he kept coming. “When the haulage truck driver saw that the Mazda driver was not responding, he avoided a head-on collision resulting in a side swipe. The Mazda BT50 veered off the road and overturned, trapping the driver and two passengers. The trio died on the spot as they were trapped in the wreckage of the vehicle,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. Acting Bulawayo chief fire officer, Mr Linos Phiri said the brigade cut through the wreck to extricate the trapped persons. – @michieroxy
