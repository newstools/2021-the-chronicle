The Chronicle A taskFORCE formed to review Covid-19 protocols in Tanzania has advised that the government should consider a mass vaccination programme against the pandemic. It stressed, however, that it should be optional to have the jab. The committee proposed that authorities should get the vaccines and start with special groups such as medical practitioners, those working in the tourism sector and elderly people. The health taskforce, formed by President Samia Suluhu Hassan to advise the government on the best way to handle the coronavirus pandemic, has also advised the government to start making coronavirus information public. The last time Tanzania issued Covid-19 statistics was almost a year ago. The 14-member task force has drafted 19 recommendations, one of these is making the vaccination optional. The team also advised the government to be well prepared for a third wave of the virus. The committee has submitted the report to President Samia on Monday afternoon at the State House in Dar es Salaam as it awaits her approval. President Samia’s new approach towards the pandemic is very different from her predecessor the late John Magufuli, who called on mass prayers to defeat the pandemic. — al jazeera
