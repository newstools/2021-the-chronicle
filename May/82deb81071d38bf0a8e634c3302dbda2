A Victoria Falls mechanic has been sentenced to 18 months in jail for stealing car parts from a client’s vehicle that he was supposed to fix. Mandla Dube of 2667 Chinotimba was given a car by Mr Dzingai Magama to fix but instead stole and sold three sensors and four coil packs. Dube pleaded guilty to theft of trust property when he appeared before Victoria Falls resident magistrate Ms Lindiwe Maphosa. The magistrate slapped Dube with 18 months in prison before suspending three months on condition of good behaviour. Six more months were suspended on condition he restitutes $37 800 to Mr Magama by August 31, 2021. The remaining nine months were suspended on condition Dube completes 315 hours of community service at the Victoria Falls President’s Office premises. Prosecuting, Mr Asher Chindedza said Dube was entrusted with some car parts but went on to steal them. “On the date unknown to the prosecutor but between the period extending from 2018 and September 2020 the accused who is a mechanic by profession was handed three sensors and four coil packs by complainant to fix the complainant’s car,” said Mr Chindedza. Mr Magama noticed that his car had not been fixed and decided to take it back and Dube could not account for the said parts. A report was made to the police and investigations by police revealed that Dube had sold the parts. The stolen parts were valued at $37 800 and were not recovered. – @NyikaLingani.
