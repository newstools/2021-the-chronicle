A SOUTH African organisation, Master G Media has spread wings to Zimbabwe and will be launched next week in Gwanda. They say it never rains roses, but when we want more, we should plant more roses and this is what the newly established Master G and Creative Arts of Zimbabwe organisation seeks to achieve through identifying, developing and promoting talent in film making, music production, promotion, distribution, theatre, dance and poetry. The official launch will be held next Wednesday at Asima Conference Room as from 10AM and is part of a raft of fetes lined up by the organisation as part of it Culture Week celebrations. Master G Media and Creative Arts of Zimbabwe executive chairperson Mthokozisi Sibanda said: “On Tuesday, the organisation rolls out the week-long programme with an executive team orientation while on Thursday a script writing workshop will be held as we move to portray the day-to-day life of communities in Matabeleland South province in an initiative being done in partnership with South African film company Unit Media House. “We will wrap up the commemorations through the Planet Kadder Academy Miss Gwanda Culture where we are forking out close to R10 000 in prizes to promote models from the small town,” said Sibanda. Speaking from South Africa, the Media and Creative Arts of Zimbabwe founding director Gerald Mabasa aka Master G said,
“Media and Creative Arts of Zimbabwe is a sister organisation of Master G Media that is a South Africa based entity which was registered in 2020, but started to serve the general public in 2016. “Master G Media has been developing, polishing and empowering skills of disadvantaged people of South Africa including some African countries,” said the Limpopo born filmmaker, businessman and media personality. “I believe it takes a village to raise a child thus l came to a conclusion on taking a step and to be in charge to empower African skills and to transform all Africans through the work of art, then I started to open Master G Media branches in some African countries,” he added.
