The Chronicle Fan-favourite Loyiso MacDonald will be exiting the daily drama The Queen after five years. It has been confirmed that the actor, who has played the much-loved role of Kagiso Khoza since the show’s inception in August 2016, will depart his role. Sowetan could not establish when his last air date would be but understands it will most likely be at the end of the current fifth season that is drawing to an end. Mzansi Magic failed to provide Sowetan with specific details on when MacDonald will last be seen on screen. According to Nomsa Philiso, the director of local entertainment channels at M-Net, MacDonald is leaving the show to “pursue other endeavours”. “MacDonald has entertained our viewers over the past five seasons and over the years, many of them have fallen in love with his character,” Philiso said. “As Mzansi Magic, we would like to thank him for his contribution and wish him well in his future plans. It is always sad when talent leaves a show. However, that is the nature of the business. It also means we are a platform that grows individuals to be more daring and more explorative.” Last year, the role of Kagiso won MacDonald his first SA Film and Television Award (Safta) for best supporting actor in a telenovela. With MacDonald’s exit, Connie Ferguson, Sthembiso “SK” Khoza, Themba Ndaba and Zandile Msutwana remain the only original cast members of the popular telenovela. — Sowetan.
