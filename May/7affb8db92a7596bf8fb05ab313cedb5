The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter MATABELELAND North Volleyball Association (MNVA) chairperson Sifiso Buhlungu says they will strictly stick to the Sports and Recreation Commission Covid-19 prevention guidelines ahead of the Preshypride Volleyball tournament set for Victoria Falls on Saturday, May 22. The tournament will be hosted by Shalom Ballers and teams that wish to participate have to pay a registration fee of US$40 or equivalent in local currency for two teams (male and female) and US$25 for a single team. This will be the first volleyball event in the province since March last year. “Seven clubs have shown interest in bringing both male and female teams for this competition. We expect more teams, but we will be revealing the number on Friday,” said Buhlungu. “Remember it’s an open tournament and any club from any province can take part. We want to ensure our athletes are safe when they return to the court and right now, we are working towards ensuring that all prevention measures are met.” Buhlungu said they were working to turn Matabeleland North into a volleyball force in the country and hence more tournaments will be staged in the province. He said primary schools in the province were not doing well at national level and they were working at ensuring the game is played throughout the year as opposed to just the second term, as is presently the case. –  @innocentskizo
