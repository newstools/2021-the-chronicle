There was no loss of life or injuries but property worth thousands of dollars was lost. A teacher who was with the children was able to pull the children out of the building before anyone could get hurt,” he said. “The staff from the school managed to put out the fire but the damaged had already been done. The children lost clothing, stationery, blankets and food in the fire. Furniture, cooking utensils and the roof were also damaged. This block houses pupils with various disabilities and now the learners have been left stranded. We would like to appeal to well-wishers to chip in with any form of assistance which they have.” <img class="wp-image-545998 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Mtshabezi-22.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Mtshabezi-22.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Mtshabezi-22-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mtshabezi Primary School disability block that was gutted by fire Mr Moyo said the building materials, blankets, beds, clothing food among others are needed.
