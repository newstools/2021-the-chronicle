THE second season of the Pazimuti: Nyaya yemangoma film is set to premiere next Saturday. A work of the Gweru arts sector, the film about a blind girl who falls in love with a musician from the ghetto, was released last year and was a breath of fresh air as it gave new actors a chance to showcase their talent. The production that also seeks to show that disability does not mean inability made strides by securing a spot on ZBCtv and went on to clinch three awards at the Midlands Teen Awards for Most talked about series, Best Actor and Best Actress. The play that was written and produced by Takudzwa “Prodical” Musadza, directed by Takudzwa Musasa and Enny Ushy Julias features actors Diana Mwenamombe, Abeline Mukanga, Monalisa Chikudo and Simbarashe Gwawawa. Commenting on the forthcoming second season, Prodical said: “The story of a blind girl who falls in love with a musician continues with some twists and turns that will leave viewers begging for more. We’ve added new characters who will make the production even more entertaining. These include Tendai Charumbira, Teclar Kamwemba, Takunda Kushora and Allen Ngwenya just to mention a few.” The producer went on to dismiss rumours that they fired some cast members after a fallout. “We want to dismiss rumours that the Pazimuti executive fired some actors and actresses as these false accusations were meant to tarnish the reputation of the series that’s doing so well,” said Prodical. Pazimuti is a series about a blind girl who falls in love with a musician from the ghetto. While showing that disability does not mean inability, the series also seeks to raise awareness of the effects of drug abuse. The production is a collaboration of 054tv Magazine, Master Minds Media and Anoe Designs. – @mthabisi_mthire
