The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Musician-cum-dancer Mzoe 7 has undisputedly levelled up at a time that the arts sector has been partially closed. Last year, he successfully pulled off an Amapiano banger in the form of hit, Asambeni that won him a number of accolades. Now he has followed up that track with Umjolo The Pandemic that is promising to change the game. <img class="alignnone wp-image-544671 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The track that was launched this past Friday at an exclusive event at Ster-Kinekor in Bulawayo, saw Mzoe 7 displaying his hunger for success with the way he staged the event and his song’s lyrical prowess. <img class="alignnone wp-image-544672 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The visuals of the song that were shot by Keaitse Films also set Mzoe 7 apart from the rest justifying his recent BAA and Zima award recognitions. Umjolo The Pandemic could not have come at a better time as it depicts how people are being caught up in deadly and toxic relationships. <img class="alignnone wp-image-544674 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Commenting on the launch, Mzoe 7 said: “It was a success. The people loved it and showed me love. I did things differently and want to thank the corporate world for coming through.” Fans of the musician also gave him a thumbs up for his mature work. <img class="alignnone wp-image-544677 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Prevail Pnqox posted on YouTube: “On behalf of all the Bulawayo people in the Diaspora, I approve. Standard!” <img class="alignnone wp-image-544680 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo5.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Umjolo5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Thobekile Maphosa commented: “I see another award knocking.” – @mthabisi_mthire
