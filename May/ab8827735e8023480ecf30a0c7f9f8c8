The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent THREE artistes from 41 entries have been shortlisted for the Centre for Innovation & Technology (Cite) Voice for Change musical project where artistes are being required to compose songs on social issues affecting communities. The artistes selected for the month of April are Kelvin Nyoni with the Amapiano song Ibhaw’za which talks about the city’s perennial water challenges, Fish F Ndaramu with the rap song Nkantolo which talks about life challenges and MJ Sings with the track Sebenza that is laced with afro-fusion sounds and inspires youths to work hard for success. <img class="wp-image-546290 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Fish-M-Ndaramu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Fish-M-Ndaramu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Fish-M-Ndaramu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Fish M Ndaramu Cite acting social media editor Tanaka Mrewa said: “We have nominated three artistes for the month of April and people can vote for these songs on our social media pages that include WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The voting lines close on Friday and the winner for the month of April will be announced on Monday.” Mrewa said artistes who failed to make it to the top three should not lose hope but start submitting for the month of May. The project is meant to empower young musicians who are between a rock and a hard place due to the ongoing pandemic that has left the arts sector partially operating.  For next year, each month will see the artiste with the best demo winning equivalent to US$200, a recording contract and music distribution on online stores. The top three artistes at the end of the programme, will get the assistance of video productions worth US$1 800 each. -@mthabisi_mthire
