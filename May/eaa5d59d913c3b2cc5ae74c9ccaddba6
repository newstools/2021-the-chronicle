Mlilo De Priest said the EP tackles issues that youth come across on a daily basis. “The EP is about new beginnings, thus the name Club Genesis. It’s about my life experiences as well as those of other artistes who’re hoping to make it in the industry. It also touches on the party life that we look forward to once in a while and does not leave out issues to do with heartbreak and umjolo being a pandemic. “Basically, I want the EP to be a symbol of pioneering the #ZimYanoWave forward,” said Mlilo De Priest. The youngster who has produced for budding artistes in Bulawayo such as SheKnows Koko and Izikhali has a project dubbed Glow Sunday Chillax event that he hosts at his residence in Sizinda. People get together for braai, drinks, vibes and good music in a chilled environment.

So, every week new tracks that were produced by Mlilo De Priest are introduced. The event is also live-streamed on his Facebook and Instagram pages. – @mthabisi_mthire
