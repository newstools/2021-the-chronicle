A 16-year-old boy from Beitbridge East who allegedly attacked his 53-year-old aunt with a log and then raped her while she bled badly from the head before stealing R1 700, has been remanded in custody to May 13. The boy, who cannot be named for professional reasons, was not asked to plead to rape and murder charges when he appeared before Beitbridge resident magistrate Mr Toyindepi Zhou on Wednesday. Charges are that the accused killed Maria Gumbo on Friday last week between 7am and 2pm in Fula Village. The State led by Mr Cloudios Karinga said the teen attacked the woman some 500 metres away from her homestead, after which he raped her and stole R1 700 before disappearing. The court further heard that Gumbo’s remains were discovered lying in a pool of blood by her elder sister around 2pm.
She then informed other villagers and the matter was reported to police. Mr Karinga said Gumbo had four deep cuts on the head and her body was found lying face down. Police recovered two blood-stained logs next to the corpse and there was evidence of some struggle, 50 metres away from where the body was found. Mr Karinga said police also recovered the woman’s undergarments 30 metres from where she had been killed. The accused, who went into hiding after the alleged offence, was apprehended by members of the community who handed him to the police on Sunday.
