The Department of Agricultural Technical and Extension Services (Agritex) will soon become a directorate called the Agricultural Advisory Services as part of a major restructuring exercise to help farmers transform from subsistence to commercial players in line with Vision 2030. The Agricultural Advisory Services will have a director for the technical capacitation of farmers and also another one responsible for training. Speaking in Parliament last week, Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement Minister Anxious Masuka said the restructuring process is now at an advanced stage. He said their aim is to turn 1,8 million households from subsistence to commercial farming in line with President Mnangagwa’s vision of transforming the country into an upper-middle income economy by 2030. “Farming ought to transform to become not just a hobby or subsistence and to become a business. It is in this regard that Government is at a very advanced stage of restructuring Agritex,” he said.
