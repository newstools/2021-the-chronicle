THE Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation yesterday launched their partnership with the Zim-Ninja Academy. The academy is led by the award-winning Sensei Wilfred Mashaya. “Mostly, women are regarded as a weaker sex in the society but this is not true since they endure the nine months’ period of pregnancy and that shows they are strong,’’ said Mashaya. “It is because of this misconception that women continue to be victimised in public places by thugs and some even get aped.” Through the partnership, women will be trained in the basics of self-defence to enable them to defend themselves, and their families, when the need arises. In a speech read, on her behalf by the Chief Director of Youth, Sports, Arts and Recreation Benson Dube, the Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Ministry Permanent Secretary, Thokozile Chitepo, hailed the partnership. “l am delighted to be part of this important gathering, which seeks to recognise and applaud the impressive work that mothers, in the field of sports and beyond, do every day, for the good and development, of this country,’’ said Chitepo. “With basic training, mothers would know how to escape dangerous situations, without being aggressors, themselves.’’ The event was attended by Government officials, members of the Zim-Ninja Academy, and representatives from the corporate world.
