A local organisation, SPA Community Trust yesterday organised a special Sunday outing for 48 elderly mothers in Bulawayo as part of the Mothers’ Day celebrations. The organisation took the elderly mothers on a tour of Tshabalala Game Sanctuary on the outskirts of Bulawayo where they were served with snacks before they were driven to the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair grounds where they were served lunch while being entertained by Hloseni arts ensemble. <img class="alignnone wp-image-545607 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-20.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-20.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-20-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> SPA Community Trust is an organisation that was formed by five diasporans who have been abroad for more than 18 years.
The organisation provides the elderly people aged over 65 years with essentials such as food and also pay for their health care especially those living with non-communicable diseases (NCDs). SPA chief executive officer and founder Mrs Nokuthula Ndlovu said they organised the day to bring cheer to the elderly mothers. “It was important for the elderly mothers to enjoy their day and socialise with others as most of the times they are confined in their homes because of their age,” said Mrs Ndlovu. She said they were taking advantage of the outings to educate the elderly on how to deal with NCDs. “We take them outside their homes to have social life so that they are not lonely,” said Mrs Ndlovu. <img class="alignnone wp-image-545608 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-18.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-18.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/Untitled-18-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
She expressed delight that the elderly were having the time of their life yesterday. “These are the smiles we wish to bring on the faces of our elders,” she said. Mrs Ndlovu said the Mother’s Day apart from enabling the mothers to interact, should be used to educate the elderly on the importance of a healthy diet. She said she had discovered that lack of balanced diet remains the biggest challenge for the elderly in Bulawayo. “We noticed that our elderly citizens suffer from a number of NCDs but they do not know how to manage these conditions that often leads to unnecessary deaths,” said Mrs Ndlovu She said her organisation members were now visiting Old People’s homes in the city to educate the inmates on the management of NCDs.
Gogo Moyo from Kezi thanked SPA for taking them out and feeding them. “We are blessed to have such people who embraced us with love and take care of our needs while reminding us that age is just a number,” said Gogo Moyo. Mrs Mpofu of Pelandaba suburb said she was grateful to the organisation for ‘spoiling them’. Ms Ncube of Queens Park said: “The organisation has taught us appropriate foods to eat for different NCDs and they have also urged us to use some herbs like moringa, ginger and garlic which is also helping us,” she said. Mrs Ndlovu of Pumula South suburb said they felt appreciated as mothers. “It was a joyous occasion because there was plenty of food and we were also given cakes,” said Mrs Ndlovu.-@michieroxy
