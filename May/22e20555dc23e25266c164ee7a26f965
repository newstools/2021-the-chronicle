The Chronicle Midlands Bureau Chief THE Midlands province has set a target of planting 11 000ha under winter wheat and barley this year, which will be divided into two schemes. This year’s winter cropping will be rolled out under the agro-yield Government programme on irrigation schemes and the Presidential winter wheat scheme. Midlands Agritex provincial crop and livestock officer, Mrs Medlinah Magwenzi, said they were taking advantage of the abundant water resource in dams across the province to open up more land on winter wheat and barley. “As a province we are targeting 11 000ha this season, up from 4 500ha. We are eyeing the abundant ground water available this year due to the good rains received,” she said in an interview. “We also have barley included under the programme, which is being extended to irrigation schemes, gardens and wetlands across the province.”
