To celebrate Africa Day on Tuesday, May 25, the MultiChoice Group will be launching M-Net Movies Afro-Cinema, a pop-up movie channel dedicated to showcasing and celebrating contemporary African films. The Afro-Cinema Channel will be available from this Friday to next Sunday on DStv’s Channel 198. The channel, according to MultiChoice, has been curated to celebrate Africa’s cultural diversity at a time that the continent will be commemorating the foundation of the Organisation of African Unity. “This channel has been curated to celebrate Africa’s cultural diversity that’s aptly reflected and captured in the work that’s being produced by filmmakers all over the continent. Through collaboration and turning challenges into possibilities, local film industries across the continent have produced award-winning productions that have launched the careers of many directors, producers and stars while also taking the ‘for us, by us’ African stories global,” read part of the statement from MultiChoice. Local production, Kushata Kwemwoyo, a character-driven drama about a vengeful housewife whose world is turned upside down when her once abusive stepsister pays her an unexpected visit is part of the films that will be shown on the channel. Other productions include Sunset in Makoko (Nigeria), Payback (Zambia), Ensulo (Kenya), The Train of Salt and Sugar (Mozambique), 94 Terror (Uganda), Joba (Nigeria), Heritage Africa (Ghana) and Back of the Moon (South Africa).
