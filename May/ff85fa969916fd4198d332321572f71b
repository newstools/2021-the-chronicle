The Chronicle Portuguese police have confirmed two British football fans have been arrested for assaulting officers in Porto. The two men were held in the downtown Baixa de Porto area. An injured PSP officer was taken to Santo Antonio Hospital for treatment to a face wound. The unnamed Brit pair were held overnight at a police station in the city’s Infante Dom Enrique Square and are expected to appear in court later on Sunday. They were among a total of four Brits understood to have been arrested in the run up to Chelsea’s Champions League final against Manchester City and after the match. One of the men, a City fan, was filmed being led away in handcuffs by several officers. News of the arrests were confirmed as footage emerged of an ugly punch-up earlier in the day at a Porto bar, believed to have taken place before the start of the match won 1-0 by Chelsea. Several men traded blows before picking up chairs to use as weapons in the Wild West-style brawl which appeared to involve two separate groups of fans. Locals could be heard tooting their car horns as they drove by. A spokesman for Portugal’s PSP police, confirming the arrest of two Brits for assaulting police officers, said: “Not everything went as planned. “Regrettably two police officers were assaulted.” — Daily Mail
