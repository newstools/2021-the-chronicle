Milk production decreased by 7,34 percent in the first three months of this year which could explain the shortage of the product in supermarkets, statistics from the second Round Crop and Livestock Assessment report shows. The 2020/2021 season report from the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement shows that the country needs about 120 million litres of milk to meet national requirements. For the first three months in 2021, a total 17 832 018 litres of milk were produced down from 19 228 393 litres during the same period in 2020. “Total milk production decreased by 5,33 percent, from 6 833 594 litres in 2020 to 6 469 310 Litres in 2021 for the month of January. In February production went down by 10,68 percent from 6 072 670 litres to 5 423 900 litres while figures went down by 6,05 percent from 6 322 129 to 5 939 808 litres,” read the report. The report shows that production levels are still short of the 120 million litres for national requirements to be met. “The current dairy herd stands at 39 000 animals with 19 000 milking cows. The national target for milking cows to meet and exceed requirements is 32 000,” read the report. “Average production per cow per day was 13 litres while the smallholder dairy sector still contributes about 4 percent of national milk production. Productivity remains low due to the high cost of breeding stock, stock feed and veterinary drugs.” A manager at a local supermarket who preferred anonymity, recently said retailers were also worried about the shortage. “The shortage is worrisome for us retailers. For me it’s been two weeks now since I last received milk consignment, especially the 400ml. The shortage is a big blow to us as it affects our sales besides disappointing customers,” he said.
Consumers who spoke to Chronicle said the shortage started some weeks ago. They said they suspected some retailers were hoarding the commodity to create artificial shortages with the intention to trigger price increases. A snap survey conducted in the city revealed that major supermarkets did not have fresh milk. At OK Zimbabwe Jason Moyo branch, there were only a few one litre bottles of fresh milk. TM Pick n Pay, Choppies Bulawayo Centre and TM Jason Moyo, all did not have the commodity. The few shops that have locally produced milk are selling it for $200 per litre up from $120. — @thamamoe
