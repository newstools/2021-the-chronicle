This is part of how the young people can contribute to their community and we are honoured that on this day President Mnangagwa also launched the statue of Mbuya Nehanda which is the beginning of honouring those heroes who fought in the first Chimurenga. We have also General Khumalo statue which will be erected. “This is an important aspect because it teaches generations to come about the importance of history and the issue of monuments is actually history being packaged and we appreciate this. People are socialized through education and we are happy with revision of education curriculum where there is now emphasis on heritage and monuments,” said Cde Chirau. The Youth League also had provincial events across the country. Environmentalist Cde Daniel Sithole who is Green Shango Environment Trust director said the clean-up was a fulfilment of a Presidential call for a clean environment towards Vision 2030 while Hwange DCC secretary for youth Cde Veronica Maligo who organized the clean-up exercise on behalf of the league said the gesture defines the African being. Receiving the groceries on behalf of the Old People’s home, Mr James Nyoni thanked the Youth League and Zanu-PF for the gesture while one of the inmates, Ms Esther Mpofu (83) who is originally from West Nicholson said it was a blessing to get a donation from young people. -@ncubeleon
