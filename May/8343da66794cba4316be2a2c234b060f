BULAWAYO City head coach Philani “Beefy” Ncube has apologised to the Premier Soccer League for his outburst following his side’s 0-2 loss to Chicken Inn in a Chibuku Super Cup Group B match at Barbourfields Stadium on Saturday. City were forced to make last minute adjustments to their starting line-up after their five players, Aron Ngwenya, Douglas Sibanda, John Chinyerere, Mpumelelo Bhebhe and Dalubuhle Dlodlo, failed to get their player licences on time. “It was a very difficult situation for us because I only learnt about the development on Friday night. There is really something wrong with our football because these are players who were playing local football and I wonder how PSL failed to facilitate their papers on time,” complained Ncube soon after the match. He has, however, now apologised for his comments made in the heat of the moment. “I would like to apologise for the insinuation in my post-match interview on Saturday that appeared to aver incompetence on the part of the PSL regarding five players ruled out of our tie against Chicken Inn. It was in the heat of the moment. As Bulawayo City coach, l wish to sincerely retract the aforesaid quote,” said Ncube. He hoped the players will be available for their next match against Bulawayo Chiefs this coming weekend. “I have all respect for the PSL leadership and systems. As l speak, the PSL is helping us with registering the five players who missed the Saturday match,” he said. The club’s administration said all was in place to ensure that the players are available this weekend. — @innocentskizoe
