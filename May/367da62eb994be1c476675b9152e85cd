The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent A 42-year-old Silobela man is battling for life at Kwekwe General Hospital after he was axed on the forehead by his alleged wife’s lover. Mr Tawanda Denhere had confronted Mthokozisi Moyo for allegedly having an extra marital affair with his wife when disaster struck. The incident occurred at Musilahobe Business Centre last Monday afternoon. Midlands provincial police spokesperson Insp Emmanuel Mahoko confirmed the incident. “It is alleged that Moyo and Mabude Ncube of Village Nduku, Chief Malisa Silobela were at Musilahobe Business Centre when they were approached by Denhere who accused Moyo of having an extra marital affair with his wife,” said Inspector Mahoko. A misunderstanding ensued, resulting in Moyo attacking Denhere with an axe. “Moyo then turned violent and struck Denhere on the forehead with an axe. Moyo’s friend, Mabude Ncube, also joined in and struck Denhere with bricks all over the body before they fled.” Insp Mahoko said police have launched a manhunt for Moyo and Mabude who were now wanted on attempted murder charges. Police are appealing to anyone with information which may lead to the arrest of suspects to report to the nearest police station. He urged members of the public to desist from violence. “Members of the public are discouraged from solving disputes using violence. People should always seek third parties in solving disputes like village elders, community leaders or the police,” said Inspector Mahoko.
