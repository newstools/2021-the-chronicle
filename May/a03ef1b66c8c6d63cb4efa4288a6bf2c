Late former Bulawayo Town Clerk Dr Michael Mkanyiso Ndubiwa will tomorrow be laid to rest at Lady Stanley Cemetery. A burial service at Amphitheatre will be held at 8AM. Dr Ndubiwa was Bulawayo’s first black town clerk who worked for council for 32 years, 15 of them as a top municipal official. According to his son, Horace, Dr Ndubiwa (86) died on Tuesday at Mater Dei Hospital in Bulawayo where he had gone for his routine dialysis session. The late Dr Ndubiwa was also described by those who worked with him as a sharp-witted person, a man of great personality and a fundi in local governance who was instrumental in the city’s growth soon after independence. In an interview yesterday, Horace said the council was helping the family arrange for Dr Ndubiwa’s burial which will be live-streamed, and in accordance with Covid-19 restrictions. “For now, the only update we have is that burial has been set for Saturday at Lady Stanley and we are hoping to have a service at Amphitheatre. We’re grateful for the help that we continue to receive from council and ideally we should be able to livestream these services so that many people can partake since we are still obligated to adhere to Covid-19 restrictions,” he said. Bulawayo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Judith Ncube was one of the notable people who visited the Ndubiwa family yesterday to pay her respects.
