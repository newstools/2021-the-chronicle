The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN long-distance runners have failed to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics, leaving the country’s hopes of a medal in track and field athletes. Two of the country’s men’s top distance runners finished in the top 20 at the Retail Capital Langa Marathon held in Cape Town yesterday, with Munyaradzi Jari coming fourth in a time of 2 hours 12 minutes and 27 second, while Jonathan Chinyoka was 15th in 2 hours 18 minutes and 35 seconds. The event, which was specifically organised for elite southern African countries’ road runners seeking Olympic qualification, saw only two runners clocking Olympic qualifying times. Olympic marathon qualifying times are 2 hours 11 minutes and 30 seconds for men and 2 hours 29 minutes and 30 seconds for women. South African men’s runner Elroy Gelant clocked 2 hours 11 minutes and 22 seconds to book a place in the Games that continue to be shrouded in uncertainty due to rising Covid-19 cases and strong opposition by host city residents, who feel they must be cancelled. In the women’s race, seconds Nehang Khatala of Lesotho romped home in 2 hours 28 minutes and 06 seconds to book her slot. Zimbabwe’s female runner Fortunate Chidzivo finished the race in 2 hours 35 minutes and 19 seconds. Lisimati Phakamile, the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) national director of coaching and talent identification development, said; “It’s unfortunate that our long-distance athletes have missed out on the last qualifying race. It was yet another case of being so near yet so far. We hope the track and field athletes will be able to carry us at the Games.” – @ZililoR
