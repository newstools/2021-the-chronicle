GOVERNMENT is conducting a nationwide assessment of the impact of the heavy rains on infrastructure and human lives. Lives have been lost while roads, bridges, schools and homes have been damaged following the incessant rains received in most parts of the country. Local Government and Public Works Minister July Moyo yesterday said Government has started evaluating the damages caused by the rains. “There is an assessment that is going on now but I don’t want to preempt anything since I’m not on duty. However, I will be back in the office starting tomorrow,” said Minister Moyo in a brief interview. On the other hand, the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development has urged motorists to exercise caution on the roads as some of them have been severely damaged by the rains. “The Acting Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development, Hon Winston Chitando (MP) would like to advise the nation that heavy and incessant rains that are being witnessed across Zimbabwe have badly affected the country’s road infrastructure. Therefore, motorists are urged to exercise extreme caution when approaching bridges as they may be weakened and/or completely swept away because of the rains,” read the statement.−@nqotshili
