African football writer Nuhu Adams says the Zimbabwe international remains a target for Masandawana. “Mamelodi Sundowns will sign Nkosinathi Sibisi (25), Divine Lunga (25) and Nstako Neverdie Makhubela (26) from Golden Arrows FC at the end of the season. “The Brazilians are not leaving any stone unturned.

He had been linked with an exit, with Maritzburg United said to have be keen on re-signing him. Mutizwa is said to be under the radar of Kaizer Chiefs, according to reports in South Africa. The striker is said to be among six shortlisted players wanted by Chiefs when their transfer ban comes to an end in August. – @innocentskizoe
