On Thursday, four suspects were arrested in Beitbridge for possession of dangerous drugs, which consisted of dagga, illicit beer known as musombodhiya and crystal meth” said Ass Comm Nyathi. More than 2 500 people have since been arrested for various offences following the deployment of a crack team of security forces to Beitbridge early last month to curb smuggling and other illegal activities. The team comprising members of the Zimbabwe National Army, Zimbabwe Republic Police Support Unit and Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) was on January 5, deployed to identified areas where smuggling and other criminal activities were rampant. The deployment followed a visit by State Security Minister Owen Ncube and senior members of the Joint Operations Command. The team has registered some successes in curbing smuggling and border jumping through intercepting smuggled goods and arresting offenders.
