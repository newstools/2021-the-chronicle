WHAT started off as a routine workout with a wheelbarrow in order to keep fit ended up catapulting former Mokis Connection dancer and lead vocalist, Phikile “Samathwala” Bhebhe to stardom. <img class="alignnone wp-image-532775 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/samathwala-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/samathwala-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/samathwala-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He is the man who would lift a wheelbarrow using his teeth and dance to the fast beat of the song, Ibhara Ngamazinyo. It was fascinating to see this act during national galas in the 2000s as some people could not believe how Samathwala could pull off such a stunt of using his teeth to carry something that weighs over 20kgs. The name Samathwala stuck with him from then on and is loved by his legion of rhumba fans. Interestingly, like a prophecy, he was given that nickname way before he started the “wheelbarrow dance”. The lanky dancer was born in Sanzukwi Village in Mangwe District, Matabeleland South on February 12, 1972. His love for rhumba music saw him drop out of school while in Grade Four at Sanzukwi Primary School. “To tell the truth. I never loved school as I wasn’t good at it and preferred listening to rhumba music and dancing,” said Samathwala. He said he briefly crossed into neighbouring Botswana where he did piece jobs before returning to the village where he was to be initiated into rhumba bands. So good was he at dancing that at the age of 16, he managed to convince the late rhumba legend, Ndux Malax to dance for his acclaimed band. “I joined Ndux Malax when I came from Botswana in 1988. I was a dancer and I earned my first nickname ‘Vezuzwane’ while dancing for him. I only left the band after his demise and headed to Madala Boy and the Shining Fellows where I continued to captivate on the dance floor,” said Samathwala. He said his stint with Ndux Malax was more of an initiation school for him. “Umdala uNdux was a teacher par excellence. He wanted fast learners and he moulded us very well. I started out on his B team which was a training ground before graduating to the senior team. At the time of his death, I had graduated to the A team and was in charge of dancing. We lost a hero,” he said. Explaining how the name Samathwala came about, the artiste said: “I got the nickname Samathwala from drummer Joseph Silwane while dancing for Madala Boy. He was fascinated by my dancing skills and gave me that name. This happened before I danced carrying the wheelbarrow. “The name got more popular when I joined Mokis Connection and started dancing lifting the wheelbarrow using my teeth.” Blown away by his antics, Themba Boyoyo Mathe, who was the lead vocalist for Mokis Connection then decided to compose a song Ibhara Ngamazinyo which cemented the dancer’s place in the rhumba hall of fame. He said rhumba fans loved it most when he lifted the wheelbarrow as they would go into a delirium every time the band played that song. This antic, he said came about as he was exercising and challenged himself to lift the wheelbarrow using his teeth. In 2012, at the height of Mokis Connection’s popularity, the band was invited to represent the country in Algeria on a cultural exchange programme which saw the band, including Samathwala, boarding a plane for the first time. “We boarded the plane at JM Nkomo International Airport to South Africa then took another from South Africa to Algeria. Abanengi babethuke (a lot were scared). I was immersed in fear of what would happen should the plane crash while we were up there in the skies. “Hearing people speaking languages that I didn’t understand really made it a bitter sweet experience. The biggest challenge though was that there was no isitshwala in Algeria as we were eating rice for the whole week. When I returned home, I had lost so much weight and everyone was shocked,” said Samathwala. The Algeria trip is one that was memorable for Samathwala as they had great performances. “The performances were very good and we represented the country well. We wanted to compose a song about our journey, but unfortunately because of money issues, we left the band,” he said. Unfortunately, after all the fame and acclaim, Samathwala said he left the band a broke man. “I made my name at Mokis Connection, but I left because of financial challenges. I did a number of songs, videos and even toured with the band, but I didn’t get a cent so it was better for me to stay at home than have my kids starving while I was making money for someone else,” said the disheartened artiste. Samathwala is now herding cattle in his rural area with his music career at its lowest. <img class="alignnone wp-image-532774 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/samathwala-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/samathwala-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/samathwala-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “Isimo singikhahlelile (the situation is bad). I haven’t been involved with any band on a full-time basis, but I’ve been assisting Modius Chauke (rhumba artiste) here and there when he has shows. I’m looking after my uncle’s cattle so that I get something to take care of my family,” he said with a dejected voice. Though not wanting to say much about his family, Samathwala said he has seven children, five boys and two girls, with the youngest a seven-year-old girl showing flashes of being a dancer. — @themkhust
