The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter SCOTLAND-based Zimbabwe striker David Moyo finally broke a 17-match goal drought when his Hamilton Academical side beat Motherwell 4-1 in a league match. Moyo, who was part of the national squad that played against Algeria in last November’s back-to-back Afcon qualifiers, came in as a second-half substitute in Saturday’s emphatic win. Before Saturday’s goal, the Zimbabwean striker had last scored on October 20 last year in Hamilton Academical’s 2-4 loss to Aberdeen. Moyo has been struggling to command a regular starting place at his club and has only managed to finish one of out his side’s last seven games played in 2021. Since last month, he has managed three starts, of which he has failed to last the entire game and was pulled out just after the halftime break in two encounters. Moyo, who’s hoping to be included in next month’s Afcon qualifiers against Botswana and Zambia, has twice come off the bench since the beginning of the year and missed two outings for his team. Lack of activity and failure to score in the Scottish league might cost Moyo a slot in the Warriors’ squad, as the likes of Knox Mutizwa, who plays in the South African Premier Soccer League where a bulk of the national team players are based, as well as Prince Dube (Azam FC, Tanzania) have been regular starters at their clubs. Barring injuries, France-based forward Tino Kadewere is favourite to lead the Warriors’ attack against Botswana and Zambia. – @ZililoR
