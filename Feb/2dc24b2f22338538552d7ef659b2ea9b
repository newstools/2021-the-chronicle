The Chronicle Former Uruguay international Sebastian Abreu will extend his world record as football’s greatest journeyman after agreeing to join the 30th different club of his career. Abreu (44) is set to pen a contract with Brazilian lower-league side Athletic Club in the coming week, which will see him add yet another club to his impressive and ever-expanding CV. The 70-cap international started his career in his homeland with Defensor 27 years ago, and has since gone on to play for teams in Spain, Argentina, Mexico, Greece, Ecuador, Israel, Brazil, Paraguay and Chile. He became a Guinness World Record holder in 2017 when he signed for Audax Italiano in Chile, breaking the then-record of 26 different clubs that was previously held by German goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenstiel. The veteran striker is reported to have scored more than 300 goals in more than 700 club appearances, while he also netted 26 times for Uruguay, with whom he won the 2011 Copa America. – Sport Bible
