The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau THE police Sub Aqua Unit has called off a search for two men who were swept away in a flooded Umzingwane River in an attempt to save a drowning cow for an R800 reward on Saturday. The police with assistance of community members in Makhakavhule area, about 15km west of Beitbridge town decided to call it a day after searches yielded nothing for three days. The team combed through a 9km stretch that included the confluence of the uMzingwane and Limpopo Rivers. Khathutshelo Mudau and Busani Ndou believed to be around 30 years had entered the flooded river in a vain attempt to get R800 for saving a drowning cow. Two people managed to swim to the banks of the river after the mishap. Matabeleland South police spokesperson, Inspector Loveness Mangena said investigations were ongoing. “A search between the place of occurrence and the confluence of the uMzingwane   and Limpopo Rivers has yielded nothing. Further investigations are underway and we want to advise people, motorists included to avoid crossing flooded rivers. This will help to minimise the unnecessary loss of human lives,” she said. When tragedy struck the four men had been promised an R800 reward by a woman who wanted them to rescue her cow which was drowning in the flooded river. The now-deceased, along with the two survivors, were reportedly coming from a village party known as a stokvel when they heard about the reward. They took an inflatable boat into the river. Unfortunately, the boat capsized soon after they got into the violent tide.
