Multifaceted artiste, Madlela Skhobokhobo has ventured into cross-border trading as he tries to diversify his streams of income. With the country’s lockdown further increased by two weeks, art spaces remain closed and this means artistes such as Madlela have no revenue streams from their art. However, in a bid to beat this and feed his family, Madlela has now ventured into the cross-border business where he will be transporting goods through a company called Dlela’s Delivery. The business serves as a runner for people who need products in South Africa to Zimbabwe and vice versa. Having conducted his research, Madlela said everything is now in place. “We want this to be very professional. We want people’s goods to be insured just in case something happens to them when they’re being transported. Everything is in place and we’re now setting up an application that’ll help customers track their goods. “This service isn’t only for individuals, but also for companies. We just get a percentage from the payment for our service,” said Madlela. He said the idea came about when he was under lockdown at home. “This is a difficult time that we’re living in as artistes. Our revenue streams have been cut because we’re at home doing nothing. So, this was a wakeup call for me as an artiste to see how I can use my fame to make money besides the art,” he said. The likes of DJ Sbu inspired the Ngamnanka hit-maker to think out of the box and find side hustles. “I’ve seen the likes of DJ Sbu from South Africa and Zodwa Wabantu using their fame to promote their businesses. Likewise, I decided to do the same, make people laugh and entertain them and also lure them to support my business,” said Madlela. During the lockdown last year, South African entertainer Zodwa Wabantu turned to selling eggs while DJ Sbu has been selling his own energy drink, Mo Faya for years.
