The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent The arts must go on is the chant by Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (RoilBAA) organisers as they have set the date for the annual showcase for August 28 this year. Despite Covid-19 regulations and lockdown measures, Nkululeko Nkala the RoilBAA spokesperson said these awards must go on. “Whether we like or not, Covid-19 is here to stay so we shall be planning around it. Truth be told, art must go on. The dates have been set and the process of planning is in place,” said Nkala, after sharing a poster of the awards on social media. Last year, the awards were on the brink of being cancelled because of the Covbid-19 pandemic that shutdown most arts spaces and events not only in Zimbabwe, but worldwide. The Roil BAAs ended up being held in November through a hybrid system, where a limited number of people were housed at the Large City hall in Bulawayo and the rest watching online at home. If all goes well, these will be the fifth edition of the RoilBAAs that started in 2017 to celebrate arts excellence in Zimbabwe’s cultural capital, Bulawayo.
