YOUTHFUL model, Chipo Mandiudza who calls herself “your beautiful nightmare” is aiming to make it big on the ramp by following in the footsteps of models such as Brita Masalethulini, Lorraine Maphala, Oslie Muringai and Malaika Mushandu. Mandiudza was recently singled out as one of the best models from Bulawayo on the Zimcelebs Instagram and also the most photogenic model. But who is this model? Mandiudza is a product of veteran modelling instructor, Sarah Mpofu where she graduated at Fingers Modelling agency. She has worked with some of Zimbabwe’s top designers such as Sozinio, Ivhu Tribe and Leico designs. Mandiudza has mastered the art of posing for the camera as the two are so compatible, explaining why her shots are amazing. She has since been endorsed by various fashion experts and she is the reigning face of Suzuki Summer Fashion Drive. Mandiudza has also been named the Ivhu Tribe best commercial model, was second runner up at Miss Tourism Bulawayo 2019 and is the face of Own it Beauty bar. <img class="wp-image-533970 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Chipo-Mandiudza-0.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Chipo-Mandiudza-0.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Chipo-Mandiudza-0-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chipo Mandiudza In an interview, Mandiudza said she feels she has made her name nationally so she has set her eyes on the global space. “My eyes are now set on the global market as I’ve passed the level of pursuing a national agenda. My vision is to inspire every young girl with a purpose.” Growing up in the streets of Sizinda in Bulawayo, the beauty said she used to be called all sorts of names but that never deterred her from pursuing her modelling career. Mandiudza said the negative comments instead motivated her to keep pushing. She said the Covid-19 street campaign photo-shoot which she did with top model, Shadel Noble as well as featuring on a media advert of Ingwebu’s Royal Mahewu, were game-changers. “Of late, I’ve been busy doing a series of conceptual photo-shoots which have been quite impactful such as the Covid-19 street campaign which I did at the early stages of the global pandemic with former Mr Zimbabwe, Shadel Noble. “I’ve also done a sensual mind-provoking photo-shoot meant to boost confidence of women with low self-esteem,” said Mandiudza. The model said her management, G-Factor has top directing skills and her photographer, Mgcini Sibanda was among the best. Sharing her plans for this year, she said: “The year 2021 promises to be a good year as I’ve a number of corporate endorsements on the pipeline including artistic collaborations in Kenya with some prominent designers and models there. “I’ll also be launching my candid on camera vlog on YouTube for my fans.” What makes Mandiudza even more striking is that she is a beauty with brains as she is studying for a Bachelor of Commerce Honours Degree in Marketing Management with Lupane State University. – @mthabisi_mthire.
