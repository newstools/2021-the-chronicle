The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter FORMER Highlanders’ striker Tinashe Makanda is among five new signings announced by Dynamos on Wednesday afternoon. Makanda was first reported to have joined Dynamos in October last year, but the player’s handlers refuted the claims despite a picture of him donning a white t-shirt with a DeMbare logo circulating on social media. His contract with Bosso expired at the end of July last year. “Dynamos Football Club would like to announce the signings of five new players. The players are Trevor Mavhunga, Frank Makarati, Tinashe Makanda, Norman Sianchali and Luke Musukuri,” said the club’s marketing and communications manager Yvonne Mangunda in a statement. “Mavhunga played for Shabanie Mine, DSTV, Starbill, Kariba Waves and most recently Triangle. Makanda was with Highlanders, having previously played for Bantu Rovers, Zim Leopards, How Mine and South African side Stellenbosch FC. “Joining from Ngezi Platinum is Makarati, who had a stint in Swaziland with Manzini Wanderers. He has also played for How Mine and Border Strikers. Sianchali was previously with Caps United, Highlanders, Bulawayo City, Bantu Rovers and Hwange. “Musukiri signed from Prince Edward Academy where he has been since 2015. Musukiri was captain of Zimbabwe Under-17 last year. We are excited and looking forward to the contribution of the five players to the club,” Mangunda’s statement read. Despite the uncertainty over when the local Premier Soccer League will return, most teams continue to be active on the transfer market.
