The Chronicle THE Pakistan women’s cricket team’s ongoing tour of Zimbabwe will end abruptly today as the side’s official carrier, Emirates Airlines, has decided to suspend its operations on the Harare-Dubai route from tomorrow. Pakistan was to play the second 50-over of the series today, but will instead board the flight back home as Emirates won’t operate from Saturday till February 28 on this route. “@ZimCricketv and @TheRealPCB have mutually agreed to end Pakistan women’s ongoing tour to Harare due to the latest travel policies of the visiting side’s carrier, Emirates Airlines. “They are now departing this Friday instead of 21 February as originally planned,” Zimbabwe Cricket said in a statement posted on Twitter. The airline only cited “operational” reasons when announcing cancellation of flights to Harare on Monday for the given duration. Pakistan won the opening match of what should have been a three-match affair on Tuesday followed by as many T20 Internationals. The Pakistan women’s bowlers ran through the Zimbabwe line-up to bundle them out for 77 and seal a massive 178-run win in the first match in Harare. Captain Javeria Khan (81) and Aliya Riaz (74) put up a 157-run partnership to take Pakistan to 255. The series was being held in a bio-secure bubble in Harare and was set to end on February 20. – Sports Star
