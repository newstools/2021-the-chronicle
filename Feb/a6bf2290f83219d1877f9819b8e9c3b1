THE Meteorological Service Department (MSD) yesterday warned that heavy rains of up to 30mm within 24 hours could cause flooding in a number of areas including Bulawayo and Matabeleland South provinces today. The MSD said thunderstorms coupled with strong winds are expected. It said due to the incessant rains received in most parts of the country, the ground is already saturated hence heavy rains of up to 30mm in 24 hours can cause flooding. Heavy rains that have been received so far have caused considerable damage to infrastructure and some people have drowned. MSD head of forecast Mr James Ngoma said due to the saturation, rains of more than 30mm in 24 hours could cause flooding. On Saturday areas such as Chinhoyi received 80mm in 24 hours. The MSD said most rains which were being received across the country were coming from the northern watershed but there would soon be a weather shift which will result in rains coming from the southern part of the country. “From the prevailing predominantly north-easterly airflow, a sharp shift in wind regimes is expected late tomorrow afternoon. This should see more moisture being driven into the south-western part of the country as south-westerly winds begin to strengthen and later veer into south-easterlies. Heavy rains (in excess of 30mm) are expected almost countrywide,” read MSD statement. “Scattered thunderstorms coupled with strong winds are expected along and to the north of the main watershed, namely in areas such as Matabeleland North, northern parts of the Midlands, northern areas of Manicaland, Harare and Bulawayo Metropolitan as well as all Mashonaland provinces. Morning rain is forecast for provinces such as Matabeleland South, Masvingo and southern areas of Manicaland. It should be mostly cloudy and slightly cooler than of late. Please take due precaution and always monitor your immediate environment.”-@nqotshili
