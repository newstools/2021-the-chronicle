The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Ponel Youth Soccer Academy (PYSA) has established a full executive as it moves to comply with Fifa requirements. The academy’s president Nelson Ndeka will be deputised by Onele Gumbo, with the marketing and communications department headed by Thulani Moyo and Paul Shoko chairs the football committee. Gerald Ndlovu, Ronnie Sibanda, Alista Njamba and Vhisa Fugara make up the technical and development committee. Ndeka said: “Everything is shaping up. We are left with finding a treasurer and heads if subcommittees. We have already bought three sets of uniforms and and are now fundraising for yet another consignment to complete the match and training equipment.” Ndeka believes that in order for the academy to fully make an impact, there has to be a well formulated leadership structure to guide the young players. The academy is based in Dete and it’s objectives include promoting, teaching and developing the game within the Dete community as well as provide quality programmes at the lowest possible cost to participants. PYSA will also promote and encourage the ideas of sportsmanship and principles of fair play. – @innocentskizoe
