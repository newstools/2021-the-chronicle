The Chronicle  The German government has banned entry on all arrivals from areas affected by Covid-19 mutations until at least February 17, with the only exceptions made for German citizens or residents. The ban came into effect on Saturday and it has been confirmed there will not be any special allowances for Liverpool. A statement from the German government read: “The Corona Protection Ordinance passed by the German government last Friday provides for only a few exceptions and no special regulations for professional athletes. “The Federal Police informed the club RB Leipzig today that the described case constellation does not fall under the exceptions.” Uefa has told Sky Sports News they are in discussions with the German FA and German government about a solution. Uefa recently changed its competition rules allowing ties to be switched, so the first-leg on this occasion could be staged at Anfield. The tie could also be moved to a neutral venue and two-legged matches can even be reduced to a single game. On Tuesday, it was revealed Uefa could impose Arsenal’s Europa League last-32 tie with Benfica to be played over one leg on neutral territory because of strict new UK coronavirus rules on arrivals from Portugal. – Sky Sports
