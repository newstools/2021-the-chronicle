The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Gwanda Correspondent THE Ntepe-Manama Community Radio Trust has finally managed to pay their license fees pegged at RTGS$93 890 which is meant for 10 years. Last year, the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ) issued licences to three community radio stations – The Mbembesi Development Trust, Ntepe-Manama Community Radio Trust and Nyangani Community Radio Trust. In an interview, Ntepe-Manama Community Radio Trust board chairperson, Ntuthuko Nyathi said they are now awaiting transmitters so as to start operations. “As we’ve paid our license fees that will last us up to 2030, focus is now on programming issues which are our core business. As for the structure, that’s a big project that needs resources and will take time to complete. “Currently, we’re waiting for public works to complete their mapping and pegging. The structure will be at Manama business centre but however, Transmedia will determine our on air operations (live broadcasting),” said Nyathi. He added that they have already started recruiting community reporters with news gathering already underway. “We already have community reporters who were recruited from their respective wards. In gathering and producing content, we’re using podcasts, Whatsapp, bulk SMS, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. “All the community reporters underwent in-house training and the station is being run on a daily basis by the station coordinator who is a professional journalist, an administrator, programmes officer who is also a media practitioner and three support staff members,” said Nyathi. – @mthabisi_mthire
