FC PLATINUM are gearing up for the Confederation of African Football Confederation Cup round of 32 two-legged fixture against ASC Diaraf of Senegal with the Zimbabwean champions training twice a day at Mandava Stadium in Zvishavane. The first leg is set for February 14 at the National Sports Stadium while the second is scheduled for seven days later in the West African country. Since being given the green light by the Sports and Recreation Commission to take part in the Confed Cup, FC Platinum intensified their preparations with a total of 26 players in camp. According to coach Norman Mapeza, they trained twice on Wednesday to Friday, once yesterday and the players will get a break today. Last Tuesday, FC Platinum announced the signing of their former striker Donald Ngoma and ex-Dynamos as well as Harare City defender Blessing Moyo who has been in South Africa to reinforce their squad ahead of the two matches. Mapeza said the new players were settling in well. “We trained twice since Wednesday. Today (Saturday) we trained in the morning only. Tomorrow (today) its rest day. So far so good, the new players are gelling in well,’’ Mapeza said. FC Platinum will shift base to Harare on February 5 to train at the NSS, which is their home away from home with Mandava not approved to host Caf matches. Should FC Platinum prevail on aggregate against ASC Diaraf, they will make it to the group stage of Africa’s second tier club competition. — @Mdawini_29
