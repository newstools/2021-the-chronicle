PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has sent a condolence message to the family of the country’s late Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Dr Jetro Ndombondayi Ndlovu, describing him as a tireless, dedicated and hardworking diplomat. The President has also extended his condolences to the family of the late Harare High Court judge Justice Clement Phiri, saying his death is a huge blow to the country’s justice delivery system and the legal fraternity. Ambassador Ndlovu (66) succumbed to Covid-19 on Saturday at a hospital in Harare after he had come to mourn his mother who died last week and his brother who died in December 2020. In a statement yesterday, President Mnangagwa expressed deep grief and sadness following the death of Dr Ndlovu. He said the late Dr Ndlovu will be remembered for his invaluable contribution to the country’s freedom and independence as well as Zimbabwe’s aviation sector where he served for a long time in different capacities at very senior levels. “I was very shocked and pained to receive the sad news of the untimely death at the weekend of our Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Cde Jetro Ndombondayi Ndlovu, after a short illness. The late Ambassador’s passing on sends a clear message to all of us that during this Covid-19 pandemic, we can no longer take life for granted until this pandemic is over,” he said. President Mnangagwa said Ambassador Ndlovu’s presence of mind and efforts in the UAE were beginning to yield positive results for the country, particularly on bilateral trade whose volumes have grown significantly in value to nearly $1 billion since his posting two years ago. “On behalf of Zanu-PF, Government, my family and indeed my own behalf, I wish to convey my heartfelt condolences to the Ndlovu family, especially to his wife Eunice and child who have lost a loving husband and great father. May they take comfort from the knowledge that they are not alone during this darkest hour of grief,” he said. Dr Ndlovu was a war veteran and was part of the Zipra aviation team as an aircraft technician. He served in the Airforce of Zimbabwe under various capacities, he also served in the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation, Falcon Air and also sat in various boards. Justice Phiri was among the group of 46 candidates who participated in the first ever public interviews for judges in Zimbabwe under the 2013 Constitution. In his condolence message, President Mnangagwa said he learnt with great sadness and disbelief upon receiving the news of Justice Phiri’s death. <img class="wp-image-529682 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Justice-Clement-Phiri.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Justice-Clement-Phiri.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Justice-Clement-Phiri-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Justice Clement Phiri “On behalf of Government, my family and on my behalf, I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to Justice Phiri’s family, especially his wife Mpho and the children, the judiciary and the legal fraternity who have lost a loving husband, father, professional colleague,” he said. The President said Justice Phiri was one of the best brains on the High Court bench whose death created a deep gap that will be difficult to fill. “His passing on has dealt a huge blow to the legal fraternity in general and to our justice delivery system in particular which counted on his invaluable membership and wealth of experience in jurisprudence,” he said. “In Justice Phiri, our country has lost a quiet and dignified judge and is all the poorer for losing one of its best brains sitting on the High Court bench. His death has created a deep chasm in the High Court circuit that will be very difficult to fill.” Born on June 24, 1960, Justice Phiri studied law at the University of Zimbabwe. After completing his legal studies, he briefly worked in the then Ministry of Local Government, Rural and Urban Development, before going into private practice as a legal practitioner in 1986. In 2004 he became an Advocate, a position he held until he was appointed a judge of the High Court of Zimbabwe on September 16, 2015 along with four other judges Justices Jester Helena Charewa, Tawanda Chitapi, Davison Moses Foroma, Nyaradzo Priscilla Munangati-Manongwa and Edith Kuda Mushore. He is survived by his wife, Mrs Mpho Phiri, and his children Mario, Palesa, Felistas and Dimpho. Mourners are gathered at Number 36 Roosevelt Crescent, Winston Park in Marondera. Funeral arrangements will be announced in due course. — @mashnets
