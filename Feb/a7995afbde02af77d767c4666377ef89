The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter ZESA Holdings has said normal power supplies are expected to resume today after a fire broke out at Hwange Power Station on Wednesday evening resulting in a two-hour load shedding. The fire incident occurred at about 5PM resulting in the country losing 140MW of electricity. Government on Wednesday said due to the 40-minute fire incident, the country was experiencing subdued electricity supplies, urging citizens to conserve power. In a statement, Zesa Holding executive chairman Dr Sydney Gata said the fire was caused by a diesel leak at one of the supply lines. He said no one was injured in the fire. “Although we lost 140MW leading to load shedding between 5:30pm and 8:30 due to suspension of load on units 2 and 5, we are in the process of firing the two units to restore power supply to the national grid. Normal supply is expected to resume on Thursday the 11th of February 2020,” he said. The power utility company is still assessing the extent of damages caused by the fire.
