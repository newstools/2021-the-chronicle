THE Medical and Dental Practitioners Council of Zimbabwe (MDPCZ) has urged students studying dental and medical programmes to register with the council to be able to undertake elective training while on holiday. The training enhances students’ familiarisation with the local system in preparation for the registration examination upon completing their degrees. Students should also register so that the council informs them on the international accreditation status of training institutions to prevent difficulties associated with graduating from poorly or even unrated medical schools. “The function of the MDPCZ is to regulate the practice of medicine and dentistry in the country by ensuring that every medical and dental practitioner wishing to practice in the country is qualified, duly registered and is in possession of a valid licence,” read the statement. “It is necessary for candidates to meet the council’s requirements to guard the public of Zimbabwe by ensuring that health care is provided by qualified and competent doctors.” — @rufarovaraidzo
