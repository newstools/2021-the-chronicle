The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent A RADIO play titled Kwatakabva Mitunhu which unpacks the Kalanga people’s way of life has completed its production with its producers eyeing to have the production on various radio stations. The play targets to bridge the social gap among the country’s ethnic groups through giving a well-orchestrated presentation of how certain communities, in particular the Kalanga-speaking, live. With 32 characters, the story is a production of Pfumbila Kwedu Arts that comprises of the writer Desire Dube, producer Zephania Sibanda and editor, Lesani Bgwata Ndlovu. The play whose production started in 2018 has 65 episodes. Each episode has 25 minutes. Some of the episodes have been piloted on online radio, Radio BuKalanga. Dube said the lockdown has stalled efforts to approach radio stations. “We are in the process of approaching radio stations so that we give them our content. Focus is on the newly licensed community radio stations though the lockdown has affected our movements,” he said. He said the storyline was influenced by his childhood. “The story is about life in a Kalanga community. As a person who was raised in a Kalanga community, I experienced many things from gossiping, lies, secrets and traditional leaders who couldn’t handle community matters professionally. “Our main characters are two families, the Khupe’s and Ndazi’s. These two families are always fighting and reporting each other to a traditional court (Khutha),” Dube said. He added: “Mrs Ndazi had an affair with the man next door, Khupe who is believed to be a fake pastor. Khupe and Mrs Ndazi end up having three kids secretly.” As fate would have it, as time went on, the children grew up and started dating each other not knowing they shared a biological father. – @mthabisi_mthire
