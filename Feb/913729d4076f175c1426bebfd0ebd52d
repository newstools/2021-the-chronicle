The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) has turned down Zifa’s request to play friendly matches in the build-up to next month’s Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers against Botswana and Zambia. Turning down Zifa’s request, the SRC insisted that because of the Covid-19 pandemic, they can only sanction friendlies against teams that are in a bio-secure bubble. “The Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) hereby gives you notice following your application that the Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation disapproved your application to to play international friendly matches in preparation for the 2022 Afcon men’s qualifying matches in March 2021. “Due to the current Covid-19 situation in the country, only local friendly matches can be done with teams already in bubble. The situation will be reviewed at the end of the current lockdown period and you may timeously apply for each respective planned international friendly as the case maybe,” reads the SRC letter to Zifa. Zifa’s application for an international friendly was ill-advised as it would have been difficult to get players in for the preparatory match, with the next dates for Fifa’s official or friendly matches set for March 18-26. Zimbabwe, second in Group H with five points from four games, will be away to third-placed Botswana for a match scheduled for March 22. It is highly likely that the foreign-based Warriors that will do duty will fly direct to Botswana. On March 30, Zimbabwe will play host to bottom of the table Zambia. Chipolopolo takes on African champions Algeria, who top Group H with 10 points on March 22. – @ZililoR
