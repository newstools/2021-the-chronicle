CHARTERED secretaries and administrators will soon assume a wider mandate if the proposed amendments to the Chartered Secretaries (Private) Act (Chapter 23:07) are approved. The move will also see the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators in Zimbabwe being renamed “The Chartered Governance and Accountancy Institute in Zimbabwe”. It will be mandated to provide education and training in professional branches, which encompass corporate secretaries, managers, administrators, tax consultants, financial managers, accountants and auditors. The Attorney-General, Advocate Prince Machaya, presented the proposed amendments on behalf of the Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Ziyambi Ziyambi. “Cabinet was informed that the proposed amendments seek to expand the mandate of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators in Zimbabwe to encourage the study and practice of accountancy and auditing by members and students of the Institute,” said Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Monica Mutsvangwa, in a post Cabinet media briefing. “The aim is to promote information and education on accountancy and auditing matters by all appropriate means, and to help the Institute to acquire any rights or privileges, which the Institute may regard as necessary or convenient for its purpose.” The amendments also provide for donations for promoting the interests of the Chartered Governance and Accountancy profession.
