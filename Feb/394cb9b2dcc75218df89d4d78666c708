The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter Former Warriors’ coach Norman Mapeza has joined a bandwagon of people calling for the resumption of football, warning that lots of players’ livelihoods are under threat. Speaking in a #bringbackfootball campaign initiated by the Footballers Union of Zimbabwe (Fuz), Mapeza said another year of inactivity will affect lots of families. Besides footballers, people affected by the continued inactivity include match officials, technical and support staff. “It is very important for football to resume in the country as you know most of these footballers are breadwinners in their families. If we go for another year without football in this country, it will affect lots of families,” Mapeza said. Players said while others view football as just a sport, to them it’s a way of life. “To us, football is much more. It is how we breath, walk, talk, how we feed our families and inspire next generations,” said some footballers. – @ZililoR
