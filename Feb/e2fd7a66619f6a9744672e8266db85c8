The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent TODAY is a special day for the multi-award-winning Ezimnyama Dance Ensemble as the popular arts outfit is celebrating its 12th anniversary. Founded by arts guru Phibion “Fobie” Ncube, the Matshobana-based group has matured like fine wine over the years, living up to its billing whenever they take to the stage. From dance sets to theatre plays, Ezimnyama Dance Ensemble has managed to outshine competition from others arts groups nationally by being crowned the Chibuklu Neshamwari Traditional Best Dance group twice, in 2017 and 2019. From the Chronicle Showbiz team to the 17-member Ezimnyama, we say Happy 12th birthday to the group’s dancers, singers, actors, poets, drummers, administrator and costume manager.
