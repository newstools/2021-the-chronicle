The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau A 41-year-old Zimbabwean man believed to be part of a syndicate of armed robbers who have been terrorising motorists along the N1 highway between Musina and Makhado towns in Limpopo province has been jailed for life in prison. Tarusenga Thomas Chunga was condemned to prison after a Musina Regional Court in the Vhembe District, convicted him on charges of murder, attempted murder, and armed robbery. He was also separately sentenced to six months in prison for violating South Africa’s Immigration Act. Limpopo police spokesperson, Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Chunga and his accomplices who are still at large had unleashed a reign of terror along the N1 between 2015 and 2017. “He was arrested in 2017 in Mahwelereng area under the Waterberg District following a lengthy investigation by our detectives. “Since then, he has been in remand prison and he failed to secure bail on numerous occasions until his conviction and sentencing on Wednesday,” said Col Ngoepe. . @tupeyo
