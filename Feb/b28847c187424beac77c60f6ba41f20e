The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter NATIONAL Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) director of coaching, talent identification and development Lisimati Phakamile says there are plans to organise regional competitions to enable some athletes to qualify for the Olympics. Athletes hoping to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games that are scheduled for this July had their plans ruined by the Covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in the postponement of international competitions and suspension of sporting activities in Zimbabwe. The major concern for locally-based athletes targeting the Olympics is failing to access training facilities, thereby forcing them to train at home. “We are actually working on organising three important competitions as a region with Botswana, South Africa and Zambia. It’s unfortunate our country’s lockdown restrictions are quite stiffer in the region unlike in other countries where sport is going on at a high pace. So, we hope that the lockdown is going to be eased soon for our athletes to join the rest of world in competitive sport,” said Phakamile. “Our foreign-based athletes are currently working with their respective clubs, while locals are getting tips from their coaches training by themselves at home.” Naaz has selected Ngonidzashe Ncube, Isaac Mpofu, Ethel Sibanda, Munyaradzi Jari, Rutendo Nyahora, Fortunate Chidzivo and Ethel Sibanda for special training to help them qualify for the Olympic marathon. The qualifying time for men is 2 hours 11 minutes 30 seconds, while for women it’s 2 hours 29 minutes 30 seconds. – @innocentskizoe
