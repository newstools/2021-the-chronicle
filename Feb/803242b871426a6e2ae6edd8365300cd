BUDDING filmmaker Legend Prince who wants to be the best in the next five years, is putting in the work and hopes by that time, big names such as musician, Jah Prayzah will be part of the artistes he will have worked with. The Bulawayo-based filmmaker has been in the industry since 2019. He has produced films such as Amending Sands and Under-Xul. He has also worked on music videos for fast-rising artistes, Ma9nine and Montel. Legend Prince, real name Takunda Prince Mafa, said he wants to work hard in order to be recognised in the industry. “My vision is to be the best filmmaker in Zimbabwe in the next five years. I’m working very hard in producing HD quality films and music videos that’ll attract the best artists like Jah Prayzah so that they work with me on their projects,” said Legend Prince. The 28-year-old filmmaker grew up in Bulawayo’s Tshabalala suburb and attended Mahlabezulu Primary School. He did his high school studies at Utongani High in Zvishavane. Legend Prince is a final year Film and Television Production student at College of Creative Arts-Africa, which is an affiliate of Midlands State University. He is now running his own Legend Prince Studios which he says it started just as a dream.“The industry has been very tough as I started off without enough equipment but now I believe I’ve achieved a lot from borrowing equipment to buying my own. I’ve also gained popularity in Bulawayo. “Having your own equipment is very important because you do your projects at your own time and it cuts on unnecessary costs,” said Prince Legend. He said he fell in love with filmmaking at a tender age. “I got into filmmaking because that is my passion. I loved film making since I was a toddler. I watched Chuck Norris films, in particular Walker Texas Ranger and Steve Harvey shows. I fell in love with the creativity and style displayed and felt inspired to work on my own productions.”
