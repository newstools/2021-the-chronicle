The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter A CHINESE gas manufacturer, Chingases Company Limited is still committed to setting up a US$15 million plant in Bulawayo but the project has been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, an official has said. In June 2018, the company announced the intent to invest said a US$15 million plant in the city under the Special Economic Zones. In an interview, Bulawayo City Council (BCC) business development officer Mr Kholisani Moyo said the proposed gas project by Chingases is one of the big investments that the city was looking forward to seeing taking shape last year. He said consummation of the project has been delayed by Covid-19. “The investor has indicated that they have been adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic but they are still keen on setting up the investment whose implementation could have taken effect last year. “In our last communication (last week) with the investor, they indicated that they are still interested in the project but the setback for now is the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Mr Moyo. Chingases is one of the leading gas manufacturers in Africa and the firm, which presently operates in Zambia, produces industrial, medical and domestic gases such as oxygen, acetylene, nitrogen and Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG). – @okazunga
