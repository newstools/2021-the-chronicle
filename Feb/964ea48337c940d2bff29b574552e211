THE National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) has unveiled the trophy design to be used at the inaugural National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) Legends@40 awards. The trophy was designed by Harare-based artist, Derwin Guti, a 25-year-old fine artist who specialises in ballpoint-pen drawings. The trophy will be presented to 40 living arts legends. <img class="wp-image-530887 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Derwin-Guti-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Derwin-Guti-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Derwin-Guti-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Derwin Guti A competition was initiated last year where designers were invited to submit their designs. Guti won the competition after beating 10 other competitors and pocketed RTGS$65 000 which was the prize money. The shape of the trophy and its opening at the stand base is quite creative, making it unique. NACZ communication and marketing manager, Rodney Ruwende said Guti will have access to the awards ceremony (subject to existing lockdown restrictions) and will get recognition in front of the legends and a large virtual crowd. “Guti’s trophy design was found by the adjudication committee to be well thought out in support of the theme. His design incorporates all the items related to the Legends Nama @40 combining creatively known and enduring features like the eternal flame, which appears to originate from the revered flagship symbol of ultimate achievement,” said Ruwende. Speaking about the trophy’s design, Guti said: “When I started creating the final design, I had two key points in mind: the NACZ, Nama logo and celebrating 40 years of legends. I made sure to apply all of that to the design. The forthcoming Nama Legends@40 awards which seek to honour and recognise living legendary creatives who have raised the country’s flag high, will run under the theme “Our Legacy, Our Pride”. They will be held on March 27 at a venue yet to be announced. — @mthabisi_mthire
