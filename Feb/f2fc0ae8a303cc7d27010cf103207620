THE Covid-19 pandemic has brought a tragic disruption to the lives of all humans across the globe regardless of their form or mental capacities. Mentally challenged individuals have been uniquely affected as most remain neglected and uncared for. It is all the more worrisome as such individuals are mostly not aware of the situation around them and therefore cannot see to their own well-being. More concern is on those who have been living on the streets during such a time. These people have been subjected to every possible vulnerability involved with the coronavirus. There has not been much aid in terms of provision of face masks or safe places to stay since the pandemic hit the nation. Hence, the issue is not only that these individuals are exposed to the coronavirus, but also that they pose a risk of spreading it if infected. It cannot be denied that people with mental illnesses remain one of our nation’s prioritised groups. A number of reforms have been made by Government to address the welfare of this group. This is evident from the speech by the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Professor Paul Mavima during World Mental Health Day late last year. He said: “The Government of Zimbabwe through the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare, and organisations of persons with disabilities is diligently seeking to address the needs and concerns of people with mental disabilities.” The needs and concerns addressed by the Government included the necessity to do away with stigmatisation and discrimination of people who are mentally challenged. Government even goes an extra mile by continuously supporting institutions like Ingutsheni Central Hospital which shelters and cares for this particular group. Ingutsheni is currently sheltering over 600 patients. The institution provides its patients with treatment, food and funding. However, Bulawayo still has a number of mentally challenged individuals roaming the streets which lost their safety since the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The national lockdowns imposed to help slow the spread of Covid-19 in the country did not cover those living on the streets which leaves the question, “what should be done to ensure that these individuals are also protected from Covid-19?” An elementary solution would be to shelter all homeless and mentally challenged persons. According to Ingutsheni Central Hospital chief executive officer Dr Nemache Mawere, this is possible. <img class="wp-image-531328 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/mawere.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/mawere.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/mawere-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Nemache Mawere “Ingutsheni has the capacity to look after all mental patients irrespective of where they come from,” he said. Dr Mawere said the patients can be admitted voluntarily or involuntarily as per the Mental Health Act. The responsibility of protecting these individuals is not only for Government and health institutions but for all citizens. Everyone has a need to be cared for, but this is not something that is seen much from the community of Zimbabwe concerning people with mental illnesses. This partly explains why there has been neglect of mentally challenged individuals during this Covid-19 era. Sadly, citizens have turned a blind eye to the needs and concerns of the mentally challenged. Ingutsheni Central Hospital clinical director Dr Wellington Ranga said the reason why there are still mentally ill people on the streets is because people do not give much attention to them. “People don’t take time to understand the dynamics of mental health and this is a problem which has persisted even before the coronavirus,” he said. Dr Ranga said Bulawayo residents should do away with treating mentally challenged persons with indifference. He gave a comparison of the attitude people have always had when it comes to their patients matched to those in other health institutions. “People rarely come to visit our patients and when they do, the attitude is always different. For instance, they don’t bring any food stuffs like they do in other institutions and this is a problem that has existed even before the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Dr Ranga. <img class="wp-image-531330 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/ranga.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/ranga.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/ranga-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Wellington Ranga Protecting the mentally ill has to be every citizen’s responsibility, even before Government is involved. It has to start with the residents who are as close as having physical interactions with this group of people. Every person needs to offer a helping hand in everyday protection of mentally challenged people. Every Zimbabwean citizen has to be more involved in meeting the needs and concerns of mentally challenged individuals. This is a call for Bulawayo residents to work towards bringing to shelter those still on the streets. As envisioned by Government, the community has to be concerned about what happens to the mentally ill, not only during this Covid-19 era but in all future situations. More attention should be given to mental health but people cannot be fully involved unless they have a basic understanding of it. There is need for educational programs around mental health where people can learn more about what mentally challenged people need. Meanwhile, keeping everyone safe from Covid-19 means a change in attitude towards the handling of mentally ill people. This can only happen when everyone works together. Protecting the mentally ill people on the streets across the country remains an idea if there is no change in the attitude of the community towards mental health.
