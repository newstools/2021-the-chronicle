The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN heavyweight boxer Elvis Moyo is expected to return to the ring after two years of inactivity after securing a fight against Romanian Bogdan Marius Dinu. In an interview from his Johannesburg, South Africa, base, Moyo said he will trade leather with Dinu, who is ranked 90th on world rankings, next month in Tanzania. The Bulawayo Bomber has been itching to get a fight to improve his rankings. “The fight is on; I’m taking it because this is a good offer. The guy is rated number 90 so, there’s no way I’m turning this fight down. Before this offer came, I was going to spend about R40 000 to sponsor a bout and pay my opponent, but now I’m going to get double that by fighting Dinu. So, fighting and beating Dinu will open an avenue for me to get more fights,” said Moyo. He started intensive training last week and intends to shift to sparring on February 20. Last December, Moyo, a former World Boxing Federation (WBF) Africa heavyweight champion, turned down a proposed title fight with Belgium-based DR Congo boxer Jack Mulowayi Nsendula. He said then that he needed at least three non-title fights before accepting a title bill. Moyo’s scheduled non-title fight with Ukraine-born heavyweight Oleksandr Zakhozhyi was cancelled in March last year following the Covid-19 outbreak. The Bulawayo Bomber has nine career wins, five losses and two draws. – @ZililoR
