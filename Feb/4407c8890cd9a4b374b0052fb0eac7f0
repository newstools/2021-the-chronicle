THE South African DStv Premier Soccer League transfer window closed on Monday evening with a number of Zimbabwean internationals that had been linked with transfers staying put. Chief among the transfer speculation were the trio of Divine Lunga, Knox Mutizwa (both Golden Arrows) and SuperSport’s Evans Rusike. Warriors’ defender Lunga had been linked with South Africa league champions Mamelodi Sundowns before the transfer window shut. Despite the move failing to materialise, reports indicate that Lunga remains a transfer target for Masandawana at the end of the season. African football writer Nuhu Adams says the Zimbabwe international remains a target for Masandawana. “Mamelodi Sundowns will sign Nkosinathi Sibisi (25), Divine Lunga (25) and Nstako Neverdie Makhubela (26) from Golden Arrows FC at the end of the season. “The Brazilians are not leaving any stone unturned. They will continue to dominate South Africa for more years,” he said. Rusike will remain at SuperSport United for the last five months of his contract after failing to secure a move away during this mid-season transfer window. He had been linked with an exit, with Maritzburg United said to have been keen on re-signing him. Mutizwa is said to be under the radar of Kaizer Chiefs, according to reports in South Africa. The striker is said to be among six shortlisted players wanted by Chiefs when their transfer ban comes to an end in August. — @innocentskizoe
