THE Covid-19 pandemic denied bonafide members of the country’s oldest football club Highlanders to gather to elect three members of the executive committee on Sunday. A fortnight ago, the Highlanders board postponed the club’s annual general meeting that should have been held on January 31 as well as elections scheduled for Sunday after authorities declined their request for a waiver to gather for the two events. Government took drastic measures to stop super-spreader events as a measure to combat the virulent second wave of the virus that has put the economy and healthcare in peril. According to worldometers.com, the database for daily Covid-19 global updates, by Sunday Zimbabwe had recorded 34 487 cases, 28 283 recoveries and 1 316 deaths. On Saturday, the country recorded 160 new infections and 15 deaths. With cases on the rise, there were fears that events like the Highlanders annual general meeting and elections, which were bound to draw large numbers, were potential super spreaders, hence the need to defer them. Members were due to elect a chairman, secretary-general and committee member, but the board decided to postpone them and retain the status quo. There were six candidates vying for the three executive positions of chairman, secretary-general and committee member that had passed the verification process by the time the postponement was announced. Incumbent Kenneth Mhlophe and Johnfat Sibanda entered the chairmanship race, while Israel Moyo and Victoria Falls-based Morgan Dube will battle for the secretary’s post, and Mgcini Mafu and Bheka Sibanda were due to vie for the committee member’s role. <img class="wp-image-524526 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Johnfat-Sibanda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Johnfat-Sibanda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Johnfat-Sibanda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Johnfat Sibanda Postponement of the club’s elections mean outgoing committee member Wisdom Mabhena, who is ineligible to contest having served two consecutive terms, remains in office alongside Mhlophe, after Moyo stepped down last week, accusing the board of violating the club’s constitution when it “extended” their stay in office. While those vying for executive committee roles continue canvasing for support via  different social media platforms, Highlanders members will have to endure the indefinite wait to have their say until Government lifts the ban on gatherings. But with reports of a third Covid-19 wave, they may have to wait even longer than they anticipated.
According to English publication The Guardian, experts believe the second wave has yet to reach its peak. – @ZililoR
