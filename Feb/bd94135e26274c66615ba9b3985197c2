THE Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) has dismissed as false, allegations that Tugwi Mukosi Dam collapsed or about to collapse. A message making rounds on social media stated that huge portion of the dam had collapsed urging members of the public to pray. Zinwa says: “We have been alerted about the disturbing and false information circulating on social media to the effect that the Tugwi Mukosi dam wall has collapsed or about to collapse. The dam is very sound and safe and under no threat of being washed away,” said the water authority. “Zimbabweans and the world at large are advised to ignore this information which may be calculated to cause unnecessary panic among the populace. We are not sure of the motive of the people who originated the information. However, we are quite proud and sure that this Zinwa designed and engineered water body remains safe. The country’s largest inland water is full and easily discharging the excess water.” Part of the circulating fake message reads, “One should note that at 1.45 PM or around that the hour a huge portion of the dam fell out, pray Zimbabwe, pray.”
