Sungura outfit, Vutika Express that hails from Bulawayo’s Entumbane suburb is set to drop its second album titled Chakomora on 1 March. The album, a follow up to their debut, Hazvikoni, will be available on various digital platforms. The songs will be accompanied by visuals that are being shot by popular DJ, Sweeto who has ventured into the world of photography and filming. Founder of the group, Alfoncio “Fonso” Masuku said the lockdown has given them ample time to fine-tune their much-awaited album. He said his journey in music has been a great one through learning from the best and ultimately assembling an outfit of four people — Lovemore “Mzet” Jaravaza, Nomore “Tomato” Vezh and Masotha. “I ventured into music in 2012 when I was mentored by Joshua Sibanda of Isizukulwane, Cornelius Moyo of Tukuye Super Sounds and Gift Amuli. “I went on to form the Vutika Express group in 2014 and we had our first recording in 2018. “We produced a 10-track album titled Hazvikoni which had tracks Kushunguruzwa, Gore rino vana vangu, Inzwai tsitsi, Bakuloyile, Idlozi lami, Nyamayembongolo, Mai mwana, Ngirozi and Tidanane,” said Fonso. He said with their second album, they hope to grow their following to national level. “We’ve finished production of the Chakomora album that’ll have tracks, Chakombora, Chikomo Chiremera, Udumo, Gonyerapamwe, Munogona, Ruveneko, Wakandikanya and Sarura wako. “We’re also shooting the visuals for some of the tracks,” he said. — @mthabisi_mthire.
