The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter TOBACCO Industry players are considering the Covid-19 factor  as preparations for this year’s marketing and selling season gather momentum. While no date has been set for the selling of the golden leaf, farmers are optimistic of a positive yields based on the good rain season. Tobacco is Zimbabwe’s major foreign currency earner generating over US$1 billion annually. Traditionally, the crop’s marketing season begins between February and March. Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board chairman Mr Patrick Devinish said in light of the Covid-19 pandemic stakeholders in the tobacco sector have made “very” big preparations, adding that this year’s selling season was also dependent on the decision Government will make on national lockdown. “The small-scale crop, which is mainly planted in December, its too early to tell how that crop is doing. We originally thought that the market might open late February…but no decision has been made yet. “The crop is a little but late than last year, so the market will open later. The tobacco industry has made very big preparations to be Covid-ready, so that will also depend on what decision Government makes on lockdown as well,” he said. According to early estimates from the tobacco sector, stakeholders this year project a yield of  200 million kilogrammes up from 185 million kg attained last year. “From our early estimates, we projected a yield of 200 million kg bigger than last year’s 185 million kg. This year it could be bigger than that (200 million kg), but then if rains continue, the crop could be light. But so far the quality of the crop is good,” said Mr Devinish. – @okazunga
