It was mixed by his co-producer Marcelo in Harare. Vunganai, a land developer said friendship starts from the house level between a husband and wife and their children. “Friendships can enrich your life in many ways. Good friends teach you about yourself and challenge you to be better. They encourage you to keep going when times get tough and celebrate your successes. “From the home structure, with the wife or child who is your friend, those are the pillars of strength and people must do everything in their power to cherish friendships,” he said. Vunganai said with the Covid-19 induced lockdown, relatives might be scarce or difficult to be with therefore the need for people to appreciate the close friends they have. He said the single will be accompanied by a video to be shot soon in Gweru. “I’m preparing to launch a 10-track album titled Chenjera, but first, I’ll drop the Kuputsa Hushamwari video through a live video launch at Sunset Sound Studios,” said the artiste. Vunganai’s latest offering comes hot on the heels of two singles he released late last year –Mwari Ndinotenda (Lord I thank you) and Kodzero ye mwanasikana (The girl child’s rights). Mwari Ndinotenda – a gospel track, featured Gary Tight while Kodzero ye mwanasikana – social commentary, featured a prominent lawyer Wellington “Jazzy Jazz” Davira.
