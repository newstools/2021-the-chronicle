Insp alleged that the four on February 5 stole a bag which contained a catalyst and two gold weighing scales from a car at Fortwell Wholesalers situated along 12th Avenue. Disturbed by cases of theft from motor vehicles which were being reported daily, the police set up a special crack team to investigate the matter. On Monday the team went to Fortwell Wholesalers and asked for CCTV footage of the day when the theft occurred. On the camera they noticed an unregistered Mazda Axela white in colour used as a getaway car and the criminals involved. After investigations the police got to know that the suspects parked their cars at Thulani Mazano’s residence where they went and arrested Thulani who told them that the two Mazda Axela cars, grey and white in colour belong to Sifiso Mapfumo. The police took Mazano to Mapfumo’s residence where they discovered the drugs. Mapfumo led the team back to Mazano’s place where a catalyst and two gold weighing scales worth US$7 500 was recovered. The two then led the police to Walter Ndebele’s residence where they arrested him and discovered eight Huawei cellphones. During the investigations, police also established that Sifiso Mapfumo and Walter Ndebele have four pending cases of theft from motor vehicles. The vehicles used in the commission of the thefts are being held at Bulawayo central as exhibits. Insp Ncube urged motorists not to leave valuables in cars and to always check the safety of their cars whenever they park especially in town. He warned thieves that the police will never tire in the fight against them to ensure that a safe environment prevails. “Police would like to urge motorists not to leave their valuables in their vehicles as this attracts criminals. We strongly warn criminals that police will work assiduously to ensure that they bring them to book,” said Insp Ncube. He applauded the support the police got from the members of the public in ensuring criminals are apprehended. Meanwhile, a 62-year-old man on Saturday lost US$11 000 and a laptop he had left in his car at the Hillside Shopping Centre. The police said the man got into a shop to buy food leaving his 28-year-old female employee in the car. “An unknown male adult approached the employee and told her that she was wanted in the shop by her employer. She then left the vehicle unlocked and went into the shop. The employer became suspicious on seeing his employee in the shop asking him why he had called her,” said the police on their Twitter page. The man reportedly rushed out to the vehicle and discovered that his laptop bag containing US$11 000 and a pistol had been stolen. — @jdgjarachara
