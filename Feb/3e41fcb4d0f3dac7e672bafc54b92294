The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent If anything, people who live in Gwanda are very proud of their town with Afro-Pop/Maskandi up-and-coming musician Mthulisi Gibson cementing this love with the release of a track titled Egwanda Emajahundeni where he glorifies the gold mining town. The track which was produced by Nesty B is laced with soulful and rhythmical sounds. The Gwanda-based artiste who hails from Filabusi said while promoting Gwanda, the track also serves as his introduction into the music industry. “The song is all about marketing Gwanda which is home to gold mines and also has a cement plant nearby that plays a pivotal role in infrastructure development countrywide. “The song is just the beginning for me as I’m now following my musical dream. I’ll be dropping another song that features Mega, a young talented musician, in the coming weeks so people must be on the lookout,” said Moyo. – @mthabisi_mthire.
