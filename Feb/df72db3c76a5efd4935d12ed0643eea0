TWO men have been arrested for impersonating police officers in Dete, Matabeleland North. David Ndlovu (29) and Posent Nyathi (32) allegedly went to Lupote Business Centre clad in police gear claiming to be enforcing lockdown regulations. The duo then demanded bribes from shop owners in exchange for permission to trade during the lockdown. Their luck ran out when an alert shop owner who is well versed with the police dress code noticed an anomaly in their dressing and confronted them leading to their arrest. During investigations, the police recovered property allegedly stolen by the duo. Police confirmed the incident on their official twitter handle. They urged members of the public to report suspicious people who claim to be police officers as they tarnish the image of the police force. â€” @jdgjarachara
