The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter LADY Chevrons captain Mary-Anne Musonda says they need to improve their batting and bowling after losing the opening of their three-match 50-over cricket series against Pakistan by 178 runs at Harare Sports Club on Tuesday. Half-centuries by Pakistan captain Javeria Khan and all-rounder Aliya Riaz helped the tourists set Zimbabwe an imposing target of 255. Nomvelo Sibanda was the best Zimbabwean bowler, taking two wickets for 28 runs. The hosts struggled with the bat and were bundled out for a paltry 77 runs in the 36th over. “I thought we did not do a good job with our fielding. Our bowlers were not as tight as we expected. We could have restricted them to a lesser total, but we did not do a good job. We thought with the pitch on offer it was going to be a gettable total, but unfortunately our batters did not do their job properly. We need to go through all aspects. Our dismissals were a bit soft, and obviously we need to work on that,” said Musonda. The other two 50-over matches will be played at the same venue on February 12 and 14. The sides will also meet for threeT20 Internationals on February 17, 19 and 20. – @innocentskizoe
