The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter The Warriors will depart the country on the eve of their Afcon qualifier against Botswana next month. Team manager Wellington Mpandare said they aren’t leaving anything to chance, as lately a “new trend” of frustrating opponents has emerged with home teams getting key players of opponents sidelined by influencing outcomes of Covid-19 tests. Last month, Zimbabwe’s representatives in the Caf Champions League, FC Platinum, cried foul after five of their players “tested positive” hours before their return leg against Simba SC of Tanzania. Mpandare said: “In terms of logistics, I’ve started doing research and there are daily flights to Botswana via South Africa, meaning that the ideal situation is to have all international players flying into Zimbabwe. Because of the Covid-19 situation, I think it would be ideal for us to leave on the eve of the match and use the results from tests done here for the game and come back, ” said Mupandare. – @ZililoR
