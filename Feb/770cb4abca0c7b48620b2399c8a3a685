ZIMBABWE international Marshall Munetsi was expected to beat a transfer deadline day switch from French Ligue 1 outfit Stad de Reims to English Championship side Derby County last night. Reports said Derby, who are coached by Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney, had made a strong bid for the 24-year-old defensive midfielder, who can also play as a central midfielder. Derbycounty.news described Munetsi as “versatile who can cover several positions. He is quick, strong in the tackle and reliable in possession, averaging an 84.9 percent pass accuracy rate this season”, adding that the championship side was prepared to knockout Premiership sides’ interest in the former Orlando Pirates star. English Premiership sides Sheffield United and West Bromwich Albion are said to have been monitoring Munetsi’s progress and it was not clear if they were also planning a deadline day raid for the player. RMC Sport reported: “Reims are open to the possibility of the 24-year-old moving on loan with an option to buy, but time is ticking on any deal with the transfer window set to shut at 11pm on Monday night.” Rooney has revealed that he will beef up his squad after the lifting of the club’s transfer embargo. “I have got the ability to bring more than one, two, three or four players if I want,” Rooney said. Moving to the Championship will push Munetsi closer to Premiership football. Playing in the highly marketed English leagues, EPL and Championship is a dream for most African players and Munetsi, who started off at FC Cape Town in 2015 before moving to Orlando Pirates, will fancy his chances of playing in one of the world’s top leagues. — @ZililoR
