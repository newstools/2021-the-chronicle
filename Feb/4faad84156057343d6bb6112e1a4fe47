The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Centre for Innovation & Technology (Cite) Zimbabwe, has pledged close to US$25 000 towards supporting the creative sector. This comes at a time that artistes are between a rock and a hard place due to the ongoing pandemic that has left most of them jobless. Cite founder Zenzele Ndebele said following this realisation last year, they decided to find ways to support the arts sector. Through the introduction of various shows, last year they focused on musicians and this year, they want to support comedians and podcasters among other artistes. <img class="wp-image-529705 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Novuyo-Seagirl-.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Novuyo-Seagirl-.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Novuyo-Seagirl--360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Novuyo Seagirl “Cite is going to roll out between US$20 000 to US$25 000 where we’ll be working with local artistes as we’re trying to support them during the lockdown. We just want to find ways to make them survive this tough period. “To support them, we’ve introduced shows like the Bits and Ryhmes and the Gags Galore among others where artistes are participating. Madlela Skhobokhobo is part of the many comedians that we’re working with under our comedy series,” he said. Ndebele said the idea is to get artistes to do skits that raise awareness on issues affecting communities and earn an income while educating people. One of the gags galore episodes features Madlela and musician Novuyo Seagirl who aced her role, showing her acting talent. Commenting on this initiative, Madlela Skhobokhobo said: “I’ll be doing comic skits for them (Cite) monthly. The skits will address everyday issues that affect people in a comic way. So far, I’ve done three.” – @mthabisi_mthire.
