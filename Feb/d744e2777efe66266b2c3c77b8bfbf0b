The Chronicle TIGER Woods was “p****d off” and “nearly smashed into director’s car” while rushing to tee-off before crash. The golf legend was staying at the plush Terreana resort where crew for the show Grown-ish were based while filming and was said to be “running late” for a meeting with two NFL stars. <img class="wp-image-449530 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Tiger-Woods-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Tiger-Woods.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Tiger-Woods-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tiger Woods The 45-year-old was reportedly in a rush when he left the resort with those on the TV set apparently saying he seemed “agitated and impatient” as he drove off. A member of the production crew for Grown-ish told The Sun: “We’ve also heard Tiger was p***** off that we were here at the resort. “Apparently he didn’t know there was going to be a major show being made here this week so that annoyed him and contributed to him being angry when he left.” Oliver Konteh, who works on the crew, told TMZ: “A little bit after 6:40am our director has come in and he was like “you know what, I almost got in an accident with f***ing Tiger Woods. He almost hit me.’” It has been reported the sports legend was running around 30 minutes late to meet Drew Brees and Justin Herbert for a lesson and photoshoot at the time. One source said when Woods entered his car to get away, he had to wait as another car blocked his while it loaded luggage. Once the car moved, Woods “took off fast”, say the reports. Speaking exclusively to The Sun, one crew member said staffers were left shaken after Woods nearly hit the car being driven by the show’s director as he dashed away “He really did nearly hit the director’s car, too, when he left this morning, which shook us up because of Tiger crashing his car before”, the source added. They added “it’s just a coincidence” that Woods was staying at the Terranea in Rancho Palos Verdes along with the Freeform show’s crew, as he “isn’t part of the production at all.” They added: “When we arrived here yesterday some of the guys were talking about Tiger staying here, too, and they were quite excited about it.” Upon hearing that minutes after their encounter with Woods, the star athlete had been involved in a severe crash, the staffer said the whole set was affected. “We’re upset by what’s happened,” they said. “Tiger’s surgery sounds major from what we’ve heard.” The 15-time major winner cheated death as the life-saving airbags deployed in his courtesy car after it careered off the road at high speed and flipped several times just after 7am, LA officials said. Woods reportedly hit a raised central reservation at “speed”, smashed through a street sign, hit a tree and then flipped his Genesis GV80 SUV several times at Rancho Palos Verdes. Woods’ trajectory was due to how fast he was “speeding,” according to LA Sheriff Alex Villanueva – The Sun
