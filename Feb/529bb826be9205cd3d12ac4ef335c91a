Matabeleland South provincial police spokesperson Inspector Loveness Mangena confirmed the incident that happened in Gwanda South district. “I can confirm that Nyasha Ncube (29) from Ngoma village under Chief Marupi was travelling using a donkey drawn scotch cart and hit a log. The scotch cart overturned on February 7. “The deceased was dragged by the donkeys underneath the scotch cart for about 15 metres,” she said. Insp Mangena said Ncube died when he was being ferried to the nearest health institution and his body is at Gwanda Provincial Hospital awaiting post-mortem.
