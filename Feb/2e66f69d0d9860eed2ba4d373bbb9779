The Ministry of Youth, Sports, Arts and Recreation has disbursed $700 000 to artistes in the Midlands under the Government’s Covid-19 financial relief to the arts industry. The pandemic has adversely affected artistes as both their local and international tours have been cancelled. The impact of the pandemic goes beyond the loss of wages as it has also affected artistes’ visibility after lives shows were banned. In the Midlands province, 471 artistes and 17 associations/ groups had applied for the relief fund and individual artistes who were successful are receiving $5 000 each while groups are receiving $7 500 each. Midlands provincial Arts and Culture Development and Promotions officer, Shockson Reward said applications for the Fund were made through the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation. He said the funds for artistes that met the prescribed requirements were being disbursed. “Approved were 112 individual applicants and 17 associations/ groups making a total of 129 beneficiaries. They were approved by our provincial committee which comprised of National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) officials,” said Reward. He said as a province, they will keep requesting for more Covid-19 relief funds so that as many artistes benefit. He urged artistes to register with the Ministry and Nacz so that they benefit from Government assistance such as the Covid-19 Relief Fund. Government last year unveiled a $10 million Covid-19 relief fund to assist artistes which was an initiative of President Mnangagwa.
