The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA has included United Kingdom-based players in the Warriors’ provisional squad for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers against Botswana and Zambia next month. The Warriors technical members yesterday announced a squad of 38 players that will be trimmed to a manageable number towards the March 22 way encounter against Botswana. Zifa had delayed announcing the squad while awaiting responses to requests for the release of players based in the UK a fortnight ago. With Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana included in the UK’s list of Covid-19 red spots, Zifa had been hoping to get positive responses soon for planning purposes. The Warriors’ UK-based contingent comprises Marvelous Nakamba, Tendayi Darikwa, Brendan Galloway, Admiral Muskwe and David Moyo. Surprise inclusions in the squad include FC Platinum’s Brian Banda, Shadreck Nyahwa of Bulawayo Chiefs and Caps United’s Carlos Mavhurume. South African-based striker Knox Mutizwa and midfielder Thabani Kamusoko, who plies his trade in Zambia, make a return to the national team setup after missing the November back-to-back Afcon qualifiers against Algeria.
