The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent CONTEMPORARY musician Hwabaraty has collaborated with South African’s Mabala Noise Entertainment artiste, Mnqobi Yazo as he makes inroads into the region. Hwabaraty travelled to South Africa two weeks ago to work with the Maskandi Pop artiste on a single titled Amandla Ami that is due to be released soon. Hwabaraty said through this collaboration, he wants to build on his Roil Bulawayo Arts Award win and Zimbabwe Music Awards (Zima) nomination. “After the nomination at the Zimas (although I didn’t win), I travelled to South Africa to work on a collaboration with Mnqobi Yazo, an artiste signed under Mabala Noise as part of efforts to make inroads into the region,” said Hwabaraty. He said he admired Mnqobi Yazo’s music for a long time. “I have followed Mnqobi Yazo and I liked what he does. He is a cultural ambassador in his country and I’m also passionate about culture. After exchanging my work with Mabala Noise, they invited me to their studios. “Mnqobi Yazo is a great person to work with and the record label has been very accommodating and helpful,” said Hwabaraty. Sharing his other plans for the year, the versatile artiste said he will be working on many collaborations. “We promise to deliver this year. The nominations were just irrigating our skills. I’m working on several projects so people should be on the lookout.”
