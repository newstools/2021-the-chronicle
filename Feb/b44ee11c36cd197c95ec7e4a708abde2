The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter NATIONAL Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) will enroll 15 people for the World Athletics Level 1 coaches’ course set for April in Bulawayo. Covid-19 restrictions have forced Naaz to limit the number of people that will attend the international course that runs from April 21-30 at the country’s ceremonial home of athletics, White City Stadium. Naaz has already sent invitations, with the athletics body president Tendai Tagara saying registration will be done on first-come, first serve basis. “The April WA Level 1 coaches’ course is on and invitations have been sent out. WA will be sending an expert to conduct training. Because of the global pandemic and Covid-19 standard operating procedures, we will be having a limited class of 15 participants. Those attending will have to find their place or come from home as we won’t have a camp like we used to do in the past courses,” said Tagara. Naaz had initially planned to hold the course last month, but due to the unavailability of international trainers seconded by WA, they moved the class to April. The course fee is US$250 and one has to pay a deposit of US$50. – @ZililoR
