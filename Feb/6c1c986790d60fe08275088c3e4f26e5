The Chronicle Egyptian giants Al Ahly and Zamalek will again attempt to sign Zimbabwean forward Khama Billiat in the next transfer window. With his Kaizer Chiefs contract coming to an end on June 30, it is understood Al Ahly are among the sides on the continent keen on this services for a possible reunion with Pitso Mosimane, his former coach at Mamelodi Sundowns. Zamalek and Pyramids have also been linked with the Zimbabwean attacker. Amakhosi have an option to extend Biliat’s stay at Naturena for another 12 months and sources at the club have suggested Chiefs will exercise it. It makes sense because if they don’t the player can walk away for free. But if they do, Chiefs can decide to sell him for a lucrative transfer fee. Ahly, who have always been serious admirers of the player and very nearly made a breakthrough in signing him back in 2016, have the financial muscle to purchase him outright and potentially offer him more than what he earns at Chiefs. Reports have placed Billiat as the highest paid Amakhosi player with a package of around R8 million per annum (possibly more with bonuses). If Ahly can buy players for R80 million from the English Premier League, can they not recruit from the continent for even less? The stumbling block at the moment, however, could be Billiat’s injury and the fact that he is more settled in the Premier Soccer League. Billiat (30) suffered a cracked leg bone earlier last month which has ruled him out for a minimum eight weeks and all but ruling out any possible move in the transfer window that closed on Monday. He has been criticised for his output since joining Chiefs, as he is not scoring or contributing enough, although he is still a regular. It’s expected then that his future will be settled in the coming months when he will be fully fit, but Amakhosi hold all the cards. – Soccer Laduma
