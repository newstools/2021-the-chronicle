Ndolwane Super Sounds’ Martin “The Big Boss” Sibanda’s long-awaited new album is finally expected to be launched on March 27 at Hillbrow Theatre in Johannesburg, South Africa. Unlike in the past when the title of the album would be a guarded secret, this time, the title of the six track Uyavuma album is already out. Through a promotion of the album that the artiste is running on social media, his fans have been provided with an option to pre-order the album. Contacted for comment, the Big Boss said: “The time is finally here! My fans should expect bullets as the album has great songs with inspiring messages.” This album will be his third solo project following the runaway Bakhuzeni (2012) and Konke Sizokulungisa (2016). Last year, the Big Boss closed the year on a high note with his release of a collaborative single with Congo Brazzaville Music engineer, Freddy Tondele. The title of the track is Bolingo Yamama which means “a mother’s love.” Looking at his forthcoming offering, it is clear that the Big Boss is taking more time to produce albums and fans will have to enjoy it as it might take another four to six years before they get another. Before going solo, Sibanda was a member of trailblazing Ndolwane Super Sounds which ruled from the mid-90s to a time when they the band split in 2011. That was after the group had given fans about 13 albums, most which were very successful and earned the group a number of music awards. – @themkhust
