The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter The death of popular musician Soul Jah Love has touched many with most people realising that some fights they engage in, especially on social media are not worth it as tomorrow is never guaranteed. With the Covid-19 pandemic claiming lives on a daily basis since last year, people are going through a tough time coming to terms with their losses and the pandemic in general. You can literally be with a person now and when you wake up, they may be gone. That is just the life we are living now where tomorrow is definitely not guaranteed. This is something social media sensation, Olinda Chapel has come to terms with after losing a couple of people who were close to her in the past year. Taking to her social media pages last night as she mourned the death of Soul Jah Love, the personality who has been a victim of social media wars where she has been bashed, posted a lengthy message where she encouraged people to spread more love than hate. “Death depresses me. We spent 2020 in agony and our timelines filled with RIPs. We watched as our friends and families mourned the dearly departed. We say departed with so much ease as if it’s just a bus ride away. “I have never felt so helpless watching the people I love in pain from burying those they have loved. Not knowing how to comfort them or even promise that it will get better. This world has become an extremely cruel world. A world were death just strikes with no warning or a calling card. This has become the new norm,” she posted. <img class="wp-image-532316 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Olinda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Olinda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Olinda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Olinda Olinda said what hurts her the most is the attitudes of the living as they have become worryingly heartless. “What breaks my heart the most isn’t death but the living. The amount of time we spend bashing each other and being savage or treating each other like dirt, you’d think we all breathe imported air. “I wish this world would be full of more love and laughter. To make our time on this earth more pleasant, I pray that we show each other kindness and humanity. I pray for a world where we are not kind to each other only in death, but in the living,” wrote Olinda. Her sentiments were applauded by many who agreed that there was a need for a change in attitude. “You are very right Mai Nandi. There is no time left so we need to give each other roses while we’re still alive instead of inflicting pain on each other,” commented one Caroline Musungo.
