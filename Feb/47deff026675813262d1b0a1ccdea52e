The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter With a number of Zimbabwean football coaches desperately waiting for Caf to resume coaching courses, it has emerged that Caf-A badge holders’ certificates have expired. Zifa has since approached Caf to sanction refresher courses that Premier Soccer League coaches and other Caf-A badge holders will undertake during the Covid-19 induced break. Zifa technical director Wilson Mutekede said Caf-A licences expire after two years. Zifa has since applied to Caf to host refresher courses and indications are that the continental body will green light the request. Zimbabwe last held a Caf-A course in 2017. “We’re waiting for Caf to approave a refresher course for the Caf-A coaching licence. You might be aware that badges expire every two years, meaning that we have to hold refresher courses every two years. Once Caf responds with the dates, we’ll notify coaches,” said Mutekede. -@ZililoR
