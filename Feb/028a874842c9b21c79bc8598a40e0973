The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter FORMER Highlanders and Caps United winger Gabriel Nyoni is expected to undergo surgery today after sustaining a nasty injury during Cape Umoya’s Glad Africa Championship match against Richards Bay on Tuesday. It’s not yet clear what type of injury the striker suffered, but Nyoni confirmed that it required surgery. “I hope it’s not the end. Never thought one day I will be in this condition. Lord heal me. Thank you for those who have been wishing me well. Surgery tomorrow,” the speedy winger wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. Former teammate Prince Dube was among those that wished him a speedy recovery: “May the Almighty God be with you in your recovery journey,” Dube wrote. Nyoni joined Cape Umoya in September last year from Maritzburg United, where he had signed a two-year contract, with the option of a 12-month extension, but continued injury lay-offs resulted in him being offloaded. – @innocentskizoe
