PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa took time from his busy schedule to host Bulawayo soccer giants Highlanders FC at the State House, promising to assist the club with their mining venture. President Mnangagwa, who arrived in Bulawayo on Tuesday evening ahead of the Gwayi-Shangani pipeline ground-breaking ceremony, as well as the commissioning of the Epping Forest boreholes in Nyamandlovu, met Highlanders leadership led by board chairman Luke Mnkandla, executive chairman Kenneth Mhlophe, the club’s treasurer Donald Ndebele and chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube. The Bosso head of secretariat, Dube, said they briefed the President about the progress that they have made in relation to the mining claim that was given to the club to ease its financial woes. “It was a great pleasure to meet the President who took a break from his busy schedule to meet Highlanders FC. We were there to present to him the progress we’ve made in relation to the mine, he listened to the challenges that we’re facing and promised to assist us in the venture. He took with him our proposal and to me, he showed kindheartedness as he listened to us,” said Dube. The Government through the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development approved relevant paperwork for Bosso to start operations at their gold mining claim in Inyathi, Bubi District last December and the club has been hunting for potential partners. The meeting with President gives hope to the club’s intended venture. Highlanders also presented a Number-9 jersey to the President as well as another framed club replica in appreciation for the mine. The major mine breakthrough comes at a time when Highlanders celebrates 95 years of existence and becomes a perfect present from the Head of State and Government. Helping Highlanders is not new for President Mnangagwa, as he once assisted the club getting their bus cleared at Zimra.
