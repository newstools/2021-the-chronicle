The Chronicle Tanta have sacked Reda Abdel-Aal as head coach just one day after he criticised two-time CAF Champions League winner Pitso Mosimane. Abdel-Aal recently waxed lyrical about his managerial abilities and lauded himself as ‘the best in the second division’ before launching an attack on Mosimane. “I see myself as the best football coach in Egypt and they gave me a team in the Premier League and watched the results that I will achieve,” he told Primo via Channel Ten before claiming the Al Ahly boss was tactically limited. The former Red Devils midfielder went on to suggest that the South African would last only one match in the second-tier of Egypt and insinuated that he’s been handed success on a plate with the Cairo giants. However, in a dramatic turn of events, club president Fayez Oreibi has now relieved Abdel-Aal of his duties after their 1-1 draw with Petrol Asyut in the relegation zone. With the historic club expected to challenge for promotion to the top-flight this season, their 18-point gap of league leaders El Sharkiaa after just 11 games proved to be the final straw for Oreibi. “Everyone thought that the team with Reda Abdel Aal would compete to ascend to the top flight in the current season, and this did not happen,” the club president told Masrway. “The fans have nothing to do with the team’s bad results, but on the contrary, the fans want the team to win and perform well.” Oreibi went on to confirm that technical director Alaa Saber has been selected to replace Abdel-Aal at the 92-year-old institution. – KickOff
