THE Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) yesterday captured a lion believed to be part of a pride that had been terrorising villagers and livestock in Mabale, Hwange District, killing 14 goats. This comes as wildlife researchers in Victoria Falls also captured a problem elephant that had been causing havoc at Victoria Falls Airport where it had destroyed the perimeter fence. Both incidents are some of the many cases of human-wildlife conflict taking place in communities near national parks. ZimParks spokesperson Mr Tinashe Farawo said the lion will be released into the Hwange National Park. “ZimParks veterinary doctors captured a stray lion near Cross Mabale. The lion will be released into Hwange National Park,” said Mr Farawo on Twitter. He could not give further details when contacted. Chief Dingani-Nelukoba of Mabale said three lions have been terrorising villagers in Siyanyanga and Mapani areas.
He said the lions killed 14 goats. “There are too many lions here and we have been reporting to ZimParks without any action being taken. Recently they were three and killed 14 goats in Mapani. Last year some villagers ended up setting a trap and captured one lion and they were arrested for poaching. “We don’t want that. ZimParks should quickly respond to avoid criminal activities as people end up getting impatient and taking the law into their own hands. Villagers are not happy because they have lost livestock. We want to co-exist with wildlife but ZimParks should protect us as well,” said Chief Dingani-Nelukoba. As for the elephant, it was sedated on Saturday night at the airport and researchers put a collar around its neck before releasing it into the bush. It will be used for research purposes. — @ncubeleon
