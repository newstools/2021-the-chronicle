NATIONAL Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) have defended their decision to charge registration fees for the international coaching course set for April in Bulawayo, saying the bulk of the money will cover transport and accommodation costs for the instructors. The course is part of Naaz’s capacity-building initiatives aimed at developing coaches that can help athletes with proper training. The course registration fee is US$250 and a deposit of US$50 is required to secure a place. Naaz have limited the number of participants for the course that will run from April 21-30, with 15 participants set to undertake the international athletics coaching course facilitated by World Athletics (WA). There has been an outcry from some athletics officials, who feel the course fee is exorbitant. However, Tendai Tagara, Naaz president, said lack of sponsorship continues to force his organisation to ask for course fees in foreign currency, as the association has to cater for the WA recommended trainers’ expenses. “WA have four major coaching areas; jumps, sprints, middle/long distance and throws. Only one course is held at a regional centre (Kenya) each year where each country sends one coach. It means in a four-year cycle; we get one qualified Level 2 coach in Zimbabwe for each of those areas. “To overcome that, as Naaz we apply for courses at our own expense. This means we have to meet air tickets for two WA lecturers, three-star hotel accommodation, lecturers’ course fees as stipulated by WA and local car rentals, among other expenses,” said Tagara. — @ZililoR
