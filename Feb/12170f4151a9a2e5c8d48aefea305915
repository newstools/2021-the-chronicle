After 20 minutes, neighbours heard an explosion and the shop caught fire. The neighbours tried to break in but failed as the entire building was engulfed in flames. The three bodies were burnt beyond recognition,” said Insp Mangena. She said everything in the shop was reduced to ashes. Insp Mangena called on members of the public who might have information that could assist in the invesigations to contact any nearest police station. <img class="wp-image-531819 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Valentine-Ngwenya.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Valentine-Ngwenya.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Valentine-Ngwenya-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Valentine Ngwenya Villagers who spoke to Chronicle said the three were burnt to death while they watched helplessly. “I am one of the neighbours and was part of those who tried in vain to rescue the deceased. We tried to fish out the child through the window but failed because of the burglar bars. “One of the deceased, Ngwenya tried to forcibly open the door but failed. They were screaming pleading with us to assist but unfortunately we could not,” said the villager who spoke on condition of anonymity.-@mthabisi_mthire
