The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent To get people into the mood for Valentine’s Day, Afro-House musician, Dalivaldo Starley (real name Darlington Ntokozo Moyo) has collaborated with a local artiste Melz and Mozambican, Meza Man for a track titled Mamiyo that is set to be released this Friday. Once released, it will be available on a number of digital platforms. Dalivaldo said the love song is dedicated to lovers as they celebrate the month of love. “The song is for Valentine’s Day. It’s a dope love song that’ll certainly unite couples or long lost lovers who want to reminisce the good old days. Mamiyo is a Nigerian word which means Mama (mother), but in this song, it was used to mean my love or my queen,” explained Dalivaldo.
