The Chronicle TIGER Woods’ family worry he may get hooked on painkillers as he recovers from his horrific car crash. A source said the golf icon, who has been in rehab, has a “deep-seated” issue with prescription drugs — and warned a “potentially huge problem” lies ahead. Tiger, 45, suffered serious leg and ankle injuries in the crash near Los Angeles earlier this week. Yesterday former US President Barrack Obama sent “prayers” to Tiger Woods, tweeting “Sending my prayers to @TigerWoods and his family tonight — here’s to a speedy recovery for the GOAT of golf. “If we’ve learned anything over the years, it’s to never count Tiger out.” It comes as police officials say that the golfer won’t face criminal charges, with Deputy Carlos Gonzalez adding: “This remains an accident, an accident is not a crime, they do happen, unfortunately.” Asked whether or not any drugs of alcohol tests were done at the scene, Gonzalez said: “The Deputy on the scene assessed the condition of Tiger Woods and there was no evidence of any impairment whatsoever. “He was lucid — no evidence of alcohol, no evidence of any medication or narcotics.” — BBC Sport
