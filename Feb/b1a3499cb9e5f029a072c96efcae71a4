Let’s work together towards the attainment of vision 2030. The National Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project (NMZWP) was mooted in 1912 and the project will go beyond serving the region. It will become a reality during my time,” said President Mnangagwa. <img class="alignnone wp-image-533740 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/VPs.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/VPs.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/VPs-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  He said the project was 40 percent complete and would be complete by December this year. “We are 40 percent of the Gwayi-Shangani Dam and the trenching of the pipeline has begun. The first stage of the project is underway. The dam will be completed by December this year. It is my commitment to address the water crisis in Bulawayo.” Investment has been made for the construction of dams in Zimbabwe,” said President Mnangagwa. <img class="alignnone wp-image-533737 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Chiefs-at-the-groundbreaking-ceremony.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Chiefs-at-the-groundbreaking-ceremony.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Chiefs-at-the-groundbreaking-ceremony-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  He said the government had already allocated resources for a number of water treatment plants in the country. “I urge youths and women to capitalize on the water projects to embark on horticulture projects. This development will transcend to other sectors of the economy. The region has repeatedly called for the development of water projects. The second republic is a listening government,” said President Mnangagwa. Bulawayo has since 2019 been grappling with probably its worst water shortage in history largely due to the effects of climate change and depleting water levels at its supply dams located in Matabeleland South. Epping Forest in Nyamandlovu is one of the key water projects undertaken by the Government to address critical water challenges in Bulawayo.
