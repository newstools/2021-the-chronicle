THE Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (Buz) will this week open its online platform for the public to vote for their best player of the past decade. The union is set to honour the team of the decade, player of the decade and people’s choice player of the decade at the end of this month. Only the people’s choice award will be open to a public vote that will be conducted on the BUZ Facebook page this week. “The people’s choice player of the decade will of course be decided by the people. We will run a poll on our Facebook page and the public will be able to cast their vote. We are very excited with this project and we hope basketball fans will support the initiative by fully participating in the poll,” said BUZ president Joe Mujuru. To be eligible, a player should be a Zimbabwean citizen, who has played in a top flight league, be it domestic or international. For locally-based players, he or she should have played in any BUZ national competition between 2011 and 2020. The other two categories will be decided by club coaches that have at least coached up to a semi-final of a BUZ national competition during the same period. All senior national team head coaches that also worked during the same period will also be part of the voting panel.
For the female team of the decade, the first batch of nominations was released by BUZ and  it features features Lucia Marisamhuka, Fiona Mukukula, Patience Chinhoyi, Helena Nyagato, Regina Chisale, Margaret Magwaro, Sibongile Mkandla, Juliet Misihairambwi, Alice Misihairambwi, Fadzai Mabasa, Charity Mkukuti, Isobel Tengende and Alex Maseko. – @innocenskizoe
