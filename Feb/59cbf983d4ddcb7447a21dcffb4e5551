The Chronicle Showbiz Correspondent FAST-rising RnB songstress Helen Nyati has released visuals of the track Mama that features Fab G Mshana KaGogo and Cliff Jeans as a teaser to her much-anticipated debut album launch. Titled Galaxy, the album is set to be released by mid-year. The video which is her first professional one was shot at Nkulumane suburb last year by Ibrah Films. It was directed by Ibraheem Kuvawoga with the photography being directed by Melissa ‘Melcy’ Ntulini. Helen, through her manager Mthabisi “Mthire” Tshuma of Zimele Entertainment and Promotions said the visuals are meant to enhance the growth of her brand. “RnB has for decades been long lost yet this is a genre that encompasses people regardless of age, culture or race. Through the Mama video I want to rekindle the fire of the soulful genre and get my peers to appreciate the sound. “Mama is a song to appreciate our mothers and let them know how grateful we are for the role they play in our lives. It does not matter if they are still alive or not, honouring them is what matters,” said Mthire. He said Helen’s album was supposed to be released last year but due to financial constraints it had to be stalled. He went on to call on interested sponsors to come on board to make Helen’s dream a success.
