He said as a long time solution to flash flooding the local authority will procure more earth moving equipment to attend to roads and the drainage system. <img class="alignnone wp-image-533033 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/flooding-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/flooding-1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/flooding-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He said  council was considering moving people from the old hostels that have become perennial flooding sites. “We need to have an investor who is willing to put up some sort of apartments where the ground floor is mearnt strictly for parking with a good drainage as part of our urban renewal. “Also the WaMlala River needs a properly designed wall to accommodate the water flow during heavy rains,” said Cllr Chitsunge.
