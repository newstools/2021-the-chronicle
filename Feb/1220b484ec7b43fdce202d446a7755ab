The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent South Africa-based up-and-coming Afro pop and RnB pop artiste, Fresh the Charmer has launched his second album titled The Beloved Ones (Family matters most) which he hopes to use to market his brand in the neighbouring country. Born Freddy Tapiwa Chipangura, the artiste was raised in the small town of Rusape before moving to Bulawayo to further his studies. He relocated to South Africa last year to pursue his music career. Speaking from Johannesburg, Fresh the Charmer said: “I’ve been a music fanatic since back in the day. I never had a certain genre that was my favourite as I loved beautiful music from the likes of Michael Jackson, reggae from Lucky Dube, jazz from Oliver Mtukudzi, dancehall and house by DJ Fresh who inspired my stage name.” <img class="wp-image-532112 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Fresh.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Fresh.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Fresh-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Fresh the Charmer It was when he relocated to Bulawayo that he decided to pursue music. “I relocated to Bulawayo in 2016 and started to be active in music two years later.

The visuals which featured RnB songstress Helen Nyati received airplay on Trace and Channel O. This year, he hit the ground running with the release of his second album. “In 2021, I’ve decided to come out guns blazing with the release of another album at the beginning of February. Titled The Beloved Ones (Family matters most), the album is a dedication to my late young brother, Reginald Takudzwa Kapfumvuti and my mother, Tariro Chipangura. “Because of the void these people left, I felt compelled to appreciate them through music,” he said.
