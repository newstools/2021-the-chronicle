ONE person died after a Mercedes Benz collided with a Toyota Hiace commuter omnibus along the Bulawayo-Maphisa Road on Wednesday. Petros Dube (55), who was driving the Kombi, died on the spot. Matabeleland South police spokesperson Inspector Loveness Mangena confirmed the accident. She said both drivers were speeding and negligent. “I can confirm the accident which occurred at the 87km peg along the Bulawayo-Maphisa road where two vehicles collided resulting in the death of one Petros Dube (55). “Preliminary investigations point that the accident was due to speeding and careless driving,” said the Inspector. The deceased’s body was taken to Maphisa District Hospital Mortuary for post-mortem and the other five who were travelling in the Benz including the driver sustained serious injuries and were taken to the same hospital for treatment. Insp Mangena urged motorists to adhere to road traffic regulations to avoid unnecessary loss of life especially this rainy season when roads are slippery. “We urge motorists to abide by the road traffic regulations to avoid loss of life. They should also note that during the rainy season roads are slippery. They should observe braking distance rules as taught at the driving school when they were taking licences,” said Insp Mangena. Insp Mangena bemoaned unnecessary loss of life saying road traffic accidents and hit-and-run accidents are something motorists can avoid through abiding by the Road Traffic Regulations and exercising caution.
