POLICE in Matabeleland South province have arrested four suspected cattle rustlers who were caught red-handed transporting three beasts stolen from a farm in Gwanda. Provincial police spokesperson Inspector Loveness Mangena confirmed the arrest of Mthulisi Ncube (25) from Sizeze area in Gwanda, Yekelani Ncube (40) and Charles Dube (48) from Lushongwe area in Magwe and Simon Sithole (45) from Pumula North in Bulawayo . They were arrested at the 37km peg along the Bulawayo-Kezi Maphisa Road in Matopo while transporting the three beasts which were stolen from Tshetshe Farm in Gwanda. The farm belongs to Mr Rain Nyathi. “The suspects were using a Mazda Bongo vehicle Reg ADC 0805,” said Insp Mangena She said Mr Nyathi only discovered after the arrest of the four suspects that he was missing 24 cattle. The case follows the arrest of two herdsmen employed by Plumtree town council secretary Mr Dumezweni Luthe who were found slaughtering cattle at his farm in Cold Ridge. Mr Luthe confirmed that the two are his employees and police were handling the matter. A video of the duo’s arrest has since gone viral in the farming community with many farmers calling on police to step up anti- stocktheft patrols. One of the herdsmen was found on the spot guarding three slaughtered beats while the other only identified as Fafa had gone to Plumtree town to look for buyers. Former Bulilima District Administrator Mrs Ethel Moyo said she lost her command livestock cows to the thieves. “We suspect this is the link that can solve the disappearance of our cattle in this area. I benefited from the command livestock programme but all my cows disappeared,” she said. Another farmer Mr Bhekisisa Bhebhe said he lost eight goats to thieves. “My eight goats disappeared and we suspect some of the thieves are our workers,” said Mr Bhebhe.
