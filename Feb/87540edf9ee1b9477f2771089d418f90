Regarding the SPSS programme, Dr Tax said the intervention has positively impacted the regional integration agenda through interventions aimed at sustaining peace, security and regional stability. These include support for the deployment of election observation missions that have contributed to the consolidation and strengthening of democratic principles, as well as the development of regional guidelines and training for conflict resolution experts and mediators.
