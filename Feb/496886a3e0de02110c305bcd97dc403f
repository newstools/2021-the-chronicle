The Chronicle US President Joe Biden and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi discussed a recent spate of rocket attacks on US-led coalition forces in the country with both saying those responsible should be “held fully to account”. Renewed attacks on US targets in Iraq show Iran-aligned factions are heaping pressure on the Iraqi government, while Tehran may be seeking leverage over the new US administration, analysts say. Iraq, scarred by decades of war and insurgency, has been a strategic battleground for arch-foes the United States and Iran, both allies of Baghdad who remain sharply at odds over Iran’s nuclear programme. Analysts and officials in Iraq say the resumption of attacks after four months of relative calm shows Iran and its Iraqi allies are now abandoning de-escalation and seeking leverage over their rivals. “It seems we’re back to last year,” a senior US military official in Iraq told AFP news agency, referring to several months in 2020 when rockets rained down on American sites once a week or more. On Monday, at least three rockets were fired at the US embassy in the high-security Green Zone in Iraq’s capital. “(Biden and al-Kadhimi) discussed the recent rocket attacks against Iraqi and coalition personnel and agreed that those responsible for such attacks must be held fully to account,” the White House said in a statement of the two leaders’ call on Tuesday. Most attacks do not cause casualties but the latest rocket attack on Monday was the third in Iraq in just over a week, aimed at Green Zone areas that host US troops, diplomats or contractors. US State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday the US holds Iran responsible for the recent attacks. – Al jazeera.
