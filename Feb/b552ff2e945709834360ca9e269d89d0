BUDDING Bulawayo tennis player Kudzai Chapepa won her second Wilson Grand Prix Under-14 girls singles title inside two months, beating Sophia Koena 6-0, 6-0 in the final played in Pretoria, South Africa, last week. The promising ace (12) won last month’s Under-14 girls’ Wilson Gauteng Grand Prix title in Johannesburg. Chapepa also beat top seed Alme van Schalkwyk 6-2, 6-3 in the January leg of the Wilson Grand Prix. She won the silverware in style to cap a fine outing, dropping only one game throughout the tournament in her 6-0, 6-1 win in the quarter-finals. Chapepa has been in South Africa since December with her younger sister Kuzivaishe, Tanaka Mhlanga and Emily George taking part in the Junior Circuit since no sporting activities are taking place in Zimbabwe. Nine-year-old Kuzivaishe went on to finish sixth in the girls’ Under-12 category. Thesly Mufunda, Chapepa’s coach, was happy with the girls’ performances. Mafunda said: “It’s great to see the girls active considering that all sporting activities in Zimbabwe are banned. They’re gaining experience with each outing and are raising the country’s flag high.”
