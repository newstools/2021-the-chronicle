For locally based players, the player should have played in any BUZ national competition between the period (2011-2020.) Only the people’s choice award will be open to a public vote.

All senior national team head coaches that have worked during this period will also make the voting panel. Each coach shall select at most 12 of his/her most deserving players per gender.

Buz president Joe Mujuru said: “These are some of the projects that we have in line with rewarding our athletes for the hard-work they have put in. We have to appreciate the amount of effort that players put into this game. “We feel this type of recognition also helps in the aspect of motivating players, especially in these times that we are in. This being the first event of this nature, we feel this will be of great importance to those that will make it.” – @innocenskizoe
