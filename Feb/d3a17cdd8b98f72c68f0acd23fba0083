FC PLATINUM captain and veteran goalkeeper Petros Mhari is confident his team can overturn the 1-0 Caf Confederation Cup first-leg playoff loss they suffered at the hands of Senegalese side ASC Jaraaf when they square off in Dakar on Sunday. Mhari described the must-win tie against the West Africans as a “big test” which they need to pass. The former Premier Soccer League Goalkeeper of the Year believes teamwork will carry them through. Mhari, who missed the Caf Champions League encounter against Tanzania’s Simba SC after testing “positive” for Covid-19 with four other key players last month, is impressed with the level of confidence among his teammates. “Everyone is looking forward to the game and I must say morale is high in camp; the guys are willing to work hard so that we get a positive result. We might be trailing 1-0, but anything can happen in a game of football. “We are capable of overturning that scoreline if we stick to the game plan and work hard. Remember this side also lost their last Caf Confederation Cup home game, which means that they are not invincible,” said Mhari. It is the bullish attitude that FC Platinum need to take into the crucial game, with Mhari leading the psychological battle from the front. FC Platinum will draw hope from their hosts’ last Caf Confederation Cup match, which they lost 0-1 to Ivorian side San-Pedro in the first-leg of the first round of the tournament on December 23. The Senegalese though went on to win the reverse fixture 2-1 to set a date with FC Platinum. Being knocked out of the tournament means FC Platinum will join other Zimbabwean teams in doing nothing, waiting for the authorities to pronounce on the resumption of sport, which has been frozen since March last year. — @ZililoR
