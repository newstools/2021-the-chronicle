FARMERS intending to start planting have been urged to plant early maturing crops as the 2020/2021 farming season is almost halfway. The Meteorological Services Department (MSD) said even though the nation is still receiving good rains, farmers should make good use of the time left by planting crops that mature early as well as those that do well under too much rains such as beans, peas, sweet potatoes and potatoes among others. MSD Agriculture Meteorologist Mr Benjamin Kwenda also advised farmers to seek guidance from Agritex officers to get a better yield. “Farmers are encouraged to plant crops that mature early and those that favour too much water depending on the region they are in. Plants such as: potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans, cow peas among other crops are now the only way to go as this may help in reducing the risk of losing to the almost ending rain season,” said Mr Kwenda. “Farmers should be quick to seek guidance from Agritex officers so they can save their crops from drowning and leaching. But while dealing with their Agritex officers to suggest sustainable ways of addressing the issue, farmers should increase the Top-dressing fertilisers on their crops especially maize.” Mr Kwenda urged farmers to be cautious as heavy rains are still expected this February, adding that the risk of flash floods is very high. “Even though we are now in the middle of the rainy season, the public should not relax thinking that floods and cyclones are gone. “Rivers are still flooded and remains a danger; cyclones are still possible as the rainy season has not yet ended, flash floods are still possible. We are expecting heavy rains this week,” he added. — @jdgjarachara
