This is but one of the many projects I’m involved in and I want to show people, particularly the youth, that anything is possible if you put your mind, body and soul to it,” said Marshal. He said he will be hosting a pizza tasting event on Thursday, which will only be restricted to 20 individuals, who will attend strictly by invite. “It’s a strictly by invite event. Mind you, it will not be a gathering as I’ll be adhering to and observing Covid-19 regulations set by the government. The pizzeria seeks to introduce competition and add new flavours that have never been tasted in the city before. The pizzas will be cooked in traditional Italian brick fire ovens which don’t distort flavours,” said Marshal. <img class="size-full wp-image-532345" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Chef.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Chef.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Chef-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Chef Haggera Moyo Today, Marshal stands tall and is considered as one of the country’s youngest social influencers, as he not only writes and motivates people, but has managed to venture and establish various business ventures.
