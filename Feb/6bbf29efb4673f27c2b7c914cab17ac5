WHITE City Stadium will host the first coaching clinic of the year, when 15 participants converge for an international athletics coaching course facilitated by World Athletics (WA) in April. The programme is part of the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz)’s capacity-building initiatives aimed at developing coaches that can help athletes with proper training. Due to the “new normal” brought about by Covid-19, Naaz has limited the number of participants for the international course that will run from April 21-30. “We are to run this 10-day course under World Athletics standards and we will observe all Covid-19 protocols. Participants will be coming from home and we want to limit the time we spend with the athletes. We feel it’s critical that we start capacitation programmes with our coaches in preparation for the 2021 season under the new normal situation created by Covid-19,” said Tendai Tagara, Naaz president. “I’m happy with the response and interest from private schools as they hold another critical group of our youths and junior athletes. Athletics has proved to be the main sport in which athletes can easily get scholarships to the USA, hence the interest from private schools,” he said. Naaz had initially planned to hold the course last month, but due to the unavailability of international trainers seconded by World Athletics, they moved the course to April. The course registration fee is US$250 and a deposit of US$50 is required to secure a place. The April course follows a similar programme held in December last year in Harare. — @ZililoR
