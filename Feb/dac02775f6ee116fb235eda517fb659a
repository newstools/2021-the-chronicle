The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) has released its 19-man squad for the upcoming two-Test match series against Zimbabwe in Abu-Dhabi next month. The two sides will square off on neutral soil as the Afghanistan national cricket team does not play at home due to the ongoing security situation in the war-torn country. Asghar Afghan will captain the squad that also includes the likes of Rashid Khan, Abdul Malik and Rahmat Shah. They go head-to-head in the first Test from March 2-6, with the second match scheduled for March 10-14. It will be the first time Zimbabwe and Afghanistan meet in the prolonged version of the game after the Asians were granted Test status in June 2017. After that, the two teams square off in three Twenty20 Internationals on March 17, 19 and 20. The Zimbabwe team leaves for UAE on Friday. Notable absentees for Zimbabwe are the veteran duo of Brendan Taylor and Craig Ervine, who both failed to join the national team camp due to illness and could therefore not be considered for selection. Also missing through injury are Tendai Chatara, Kyle Jarvis and Peter Moor.
