While some artistes are almost calling it quits due to the unending Covid-19 lockdowns that have crippled their artistry, comedian Nceku is one of the few who has been consistent with his craft, emerging as one the most hilarious. The South Africa-based comedian has been using online platforms to entertain his fans with his jokes making him a social media sensation. The comedian-cum-musician recently dropped a song titled Umsindo Nki that seems to be slowly becoming an anthem. The song truly defines his Filabusi roots as it is filled with tshibilika/rhumba beats. Listening to the track, one feels like dancing along while also having their ribs cracked as Nceku threw in his punches to try and cheer up people who are getting fed up of being confined to their homes. Nceku said he produced the song to entertain people during the lockdown while also educating them on various issues. “The track was produced by Nesh at Rock Up Studios Bulawayo. It’s a comic song meant to entertain and educate. For now, it’s only available on YouTube although we’ll soon make it available on other digital platforms,” said Nceku.
“The aim is to be visible across all social media platforms. Of late, Tik Tok is trending and it’s been leading in penetrating the South African market with a number taking up the Nceku Tik Tok challenges,” he said. – @mthabisi_mthire
