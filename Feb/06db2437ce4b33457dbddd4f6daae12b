The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter COSAFA concluded its annual general meeting (AGM) held in Johannesburg at the weekend with Fifa president Gianni Infantino saying only unity can move the game forward on the continent. “We all have to work for unity, to bring everyone in Africa together. I said this to you at the Caf congress. We are all Fifa, we have to work together to have a united Africa, for global football’s sake. Africa needs to start to get back what it has given to world football,” said Infantino. The Cosafa AGM came at a crucial time when African football leaders will vote for a new Caf boss next month. The 14 Cosafa members unanimously agreed that billionaire Mamelodi Sundowns owner Patrice Motsepe is the best candidate to lead Caf into a new era of transparency and good governance. “Dr Motsepe is our candidate, and we endorse him fully. We believe he has the right mix of business acumen and connections in the corporate world to lead Caf through what will be a difficult period in the coming years. “The name of Motsepe is synonymous with good governance and integrity, and he is the perfect candidate to meet the challenges football on our continent faces. Fifa president Gianni Infantino often talks of how unity is required in African football to move the game forward and we firmly believe Motsepe can bring that,” said Cosafa president Phillip Chiyangwa said. Motsepe will contest against Mauritania FA president Ahmed Yahya, Ivory Coast’s Jacques Anouma and Senegal FA president Augustin Senghor. The elections are set for March 12 at the Caf Congress in Rabat, Morocco. Whoever becomes Caf president on March 12 will automatically assume the role of Fifa vice-president. – @innocentskizoe
