SOUL Jah Love was conferred Liberation Hero status because he was a hero in his own right and the status befits his immense contribution to the country’s arts sector and placing Zimbabwe first. Soul Jah Love will be buried tomorrow at Warren Hills Cemetery in Harare through a State-sponsored funeral. Zanu-PF Youth League, through its Harare province requested that Soul Jah Love, who died on Tuesday, be considered as a Liberation Hero. <img class="alignnone wp-image-532577 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Soul-Jah-love-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Soul-Jah-love-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Soul-Jah-love-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A letter by Zanu-PF secretary for administration Obert Mpofu confirmed that President Emmerson Mnangagwa had conferred Soul Jah Love, real name Soul Muzavazi Musaka, Liberation Hero status. “His Excellency, the President and First Secretary of Zanu-PF, Cde ED Mnangagwa has conferred Liberation Hero Status to the late Cde Soul Muzavazi Musaka who passed away on 16th February 2021 at Mbuya Dorcus Hospital. The family can be contacted through our Harare Provincial office. “I shall be most grateful if you would make the usual armaments for his burial and payment of benefits to his family. He is from Harare province,” read the letter. Zanu-PF acting deputy secretary for youth affairs Tendai Chirau said Soul Jah Love was a hero in his own right and the honour was not only for to those who fought in the war. “Formerly it was called Provincial Hero, so it was normally given to people who participated in the liberation struggle. But now he (Soul Jah Love) was a young man who contributed through music and art he was a hero in his own right. There were some other artistes conferred the same status, for example Simon Chopper Chimbetu, and other youth were given that status like Magura Charumbira. It’s a status that is given to Soul Jah Love not that he participated in the liberation war,” said Chirau. Magura Charumbira, shot to national prominence for leading Zanu-PF youths to boo former First Lady Grace Mugabe at a rally in Bulawayo in 2017. He died in a car crash in 2018 and was declared a Liberation Hero.
Chirau said in a statement that Zimdancehall was the brainchild of Zanu-PF to promote youth and Soul Jah Love was a rare talent. “Zimdancehall is one of the most visible products of Zanu-PF’s deliberate drive to promote local content in the arts industry in order to raise the consciousness of the youth and empower them to realise their potential in the creative arts industry. Gingerly, Soul Jah Love stepped forward to become one of its most unassuming proponents, quickly capturing the national imagination as both a mercurial lyricist and prolific songwriter. <img class="alignnone wp-image-532582 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/jah-love.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/jah-love.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/jah-love-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He was a rare talent who spiritedly blazed his way through different social classes and generations, grooming a lot of youngsters along the way,” said Chirau. “His signature beats and content touched the hearts of many, and even aesthetically decorated radio and television slots, a fact which made him a firm favourite and permanent fixture at many State occasions, where he always sang his heart out in support of national progress and development.” Chirau said Soul Jah Love’s lyrics flowed naturally and enabled him to coin his own terms that became popular. “His linguistic prowess endures through some of the words he coined or adapted to air his songs. Words like ‘Chigunduru’ and ‘Pamamonya ipapo’ have indeed become some of the indelible footprints he left us in street lingo,” said Chirau. He said Soul Jah Love’s lyrics exuded patriotism such as in the track Simudza Mureza. “His rapidly flourishing discography, featuring songs such as Simudza Mureza, always tended towards planting a patriotic spirit among young people. The Pamamonya Ipapo hitmaker was born with the genes of generating brilliant appealing lyrics as evidenced by his linguistic proficiency and competency in coining words and chants like ‘Chibabababa,’ ‘Chigunduru,’ ‘High Definition,’ ‘Pamamonya Ipapo’ and ‘Television Thing,’ amongst a host of other lyrics,” said Chirau. He said Soul Jah Love will be sorely missed. “His powerful harmonious rhythmic, poetic, soulful and danceable music appealed and captivated to all demographic groups. Chibaba will forever remain in the hearts of all progressive and peace-loving Zimbabwe whose life was dedicated to placing Zimbabwe first in all aspects of life whether at home or abroad. Rest in eternal peace Jah Love,” said Chirau.
