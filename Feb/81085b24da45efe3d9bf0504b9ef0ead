The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Local artistes have paid tribute to Freshmap, a clothing label that has been dressing most of them. Those, among them musicians Madlela Skhobokhobo and Zinjaziyamluma, who have had the privilege of donning the apparel are in agreement that they have been admired by members of the public because of the brand’s originality and exceptionality. On its part, the brand that is based in South Africa, is growing as it has made inroads locally. <img class="wp-image-530076 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Madlela-in-freshman-...jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Madlela-in-freshman-...jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Madlela-in-freshman-..-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Madlela in Freshmap apparel The brainchild of Bhekinkosi “Bhaker Golide” Tshuma, it is hard to believe that Freshmap is an idea that evolved from a dream. Now, it is sought after with celebrities such as JayCee and DJ Unity among others being spotted wearing it. For a while now, the brand has been supporting artistes by dressing them for various events and projects. Because of this kind gesture, artistes have felt compelled to pay homage through tracks that resemble the coolness and support of Bhaker Golide. Madlela Skhobokhobo dropped a splash song titled Freshmap Yabantwana last month while JayCee who is based in South Africa, dropped an Amapiano track titled Fresh Map in honour of the brand last November. Madlela Skhobokhobo trended last year after he announced that he was ditching his formal look for a trendy look of an overall. The overall was a personalised Fresh Map one. Commenting on the role Freshmap has played, Madlela said he decided to thank the brand owner through a song as he appreciates his continued support. <img class="wp-image-530073 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Bhaker-Golide-and-son-Owethu-Tshuma-donning-Fresh-Map-personalised-overalls-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Bhaker-Golide-and-son-Owethu-Tshuma-donning-Fresh-Map-personalised-overalls-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Bhaker-Golide-and-son-Owethu-Tshuma-donning-Fresh-Map-personalised-overalls-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bhaker Golide and son Owethu Tshuma donning Fresh Map personalised overalls “Through the song we appreciate the brand Freshmap and the good work they are doing. Most Freshmap clients are very fond of splash music hence we felt it was proper to use that genre,” said Madlela Skhobokhobo. Speaking from his South African base, Bhaker Golide said: “It’s a great honour to be given such recognition by revered artistes. I am pleased that the brand is slowly turning to an empire for my son.” He revealed plans to partner with top model, Thubelihle Masina from Entumbane Pongola, Kwazulu Natal in South Africa as they move in to grow their brand. – @mthabisi_mthire
