THE Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) has introduced an electronic licensing platform for players in the petroleum sector. The issuing of electronic licences, which are being distributed by electronic mail, began last week. In view of lockdown restrictions on movement and the need for social distancing under the Covid-19 mitigation measures, there has been speedy adoption of digital business processes and transactions. “Zera is delighted to announce to stakeholders that, with effect from 25 January 2021, the authority is now issuing electronic licences (e-licences) for the petroleum sector,” said the regulator in a public notice. “Initially, e-licences will be issued for the following licence categories: petroleum retail, petroleum wholesale, petroleum production (blending), Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) retail and LPG wholesale.” According to the authority, once the e-licences have been received, players are required to display printed copies in a prominent place as required by law. Zera said all the licences will have security features namely, 2D Data Matrix, ID Linear Bar Code, unique licence number, and a watermark. “E-licences can be verified upon request via licencing@zera.co.zw,” said Zera.
