The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Up-and-coming Bulawayo-based songstress Sakhile Sibanda aka Philaaah Sibz and Norton-based musician Shaquille Chuma aka Shaquille Kings have joined forces to collaborate on a track titled Ngizom’dumisa. The Limpopo house song which has a gospel feel was released last week. It was produced by Norton-based producer Projusa Watta and talks about God’s greatness and the need to praise Him always. Shaquille Kings and Philaaah Sibz met in 2019 in Bulawayo during the former’s video shoot for gqom song, Jaiva which is yet to be released. Since then, they have been on a drive to bridge the regional gap among the arts sector. <img class="wp-image-531941 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Philaah-Sibbz.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Philaah-Sibbz.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Philaah-Sibbz-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Philaaah Sibz Twenty-six-year-old Philaaah Sibz who is a newbie in the music scene after jumping off the modelling ramp to pick up the studio mic last year said it was great working with Shaquille Kings.

In 2018, I featured on Chanter TJ’s track that was played ZBCtv’s Woza Friday and Coke On The Beat shows. “Later that year, Thulamzala was selected as a theme song for Dlala Ngamla, a Bulawayo TV series which airs on ZBCtv,” he said.
