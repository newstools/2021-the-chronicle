The Chronicle BRITAIN and Canada imposed sanctions on Myanmar’s ruling generals yesterday for toppling the civilian-led government while Japan said it had agreed with the United States, India and Australia that democracy must be restored there quickly. Western countries have condemned the Feb. 1 overthrow and detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, which has also brought daily mass demonstrations to the streets of the Southeast Asian country. Following sanctions from the United States announced last week, both Britain and Canada announced measures.
Britain said it would impose asset freezes and travel bans on three generals while Canada said it would take action against nine military officials. “We, alongside our international allies, will hold the Myanmar military to account for their violations of human rights and pursue justice for the Myanmar people,” British foreign minister Dominic Raab said. Britain already had sanctions in place on junta leader Min Aung Hlaing, accusing him of human rights abuses against Muslim Rohingya and other ethnic minority groups. Myanmar’s government made no immediate reaction to the new sanctions. On Tuesday, an army spokesman told a news conference that sanctions had been expected. The coup halted a tentative transition to democracy that began in 2011 after nearly half a century of army rule, raising fears of a return to an old era of isolation despite the generals’ promise to hold fair elections. Also yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said he had agreed with his US, Indian and Australian counterparts in the so-called Quad grouping that democracy must be restored quickly in Myanmar. — Reuters
