GWANDA-based comedian Lincoln Magabo has released his first single, an RnB song titled Yindaba Uyisinkwa, Maskup. The track that was produced by JayD the Poet features up-and-coming artistes from the mining town and these are Petty Mcroc, JayD the Poet, Pauline Popo and youthful motivational preacher, Pastor Lee. The single was accompanied by visuals of picturesque scenes that were shot by Africulture Studio at one of Gwanda’s oldest suburbs, Geneva. Commenting on the song, Magabo said: “The track was inspired by the ongoing pandemic. It’s an awareness song dedicated to the youths who dread wearing masks as they feel it affects their dress code. “The lyrics narrate a story of a school girl named Pauline who refuses to wear a mask. A community leader then advises her to wear a mask and tells her the risks of not wearing one.” Meanwhile, Magabo through his hilarious skits online managed to bag an award at The Eminent in Sports Music and Academic awards in the Best Comedian category. — @mthabisi_mthire
