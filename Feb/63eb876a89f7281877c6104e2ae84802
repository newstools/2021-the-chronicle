GOSPEL musician, Vusa Mangena says God never ceases to amaze him as proved by his recent nomination at the Zimbabwe Music Awards under the Best Traditional Gospel category. Mangena who has been doing well in the gospel industry is nominated with Mambo Dhuterere, Sipho Snowy and Kea Love. He said he is grateful for the nomination as it shows that his music is being appreciated by people. “What I can say is that God is great and He never ceases to amaze me. I’m very ecstatic about the nomination as I didn’t expect it. This is testament of the support I’ve been receiving from people who love and appreciate my music. “As a result, I’ve been challenged to do more and work harder as I know that there are a lot of people who believe in me,” said Vusa Mangena. The musician who is behind the Silwele hit, said he is now eyeing a collaboration with South Africa’s Dumi Mkokstad. “I want to work with Dumi Mkokstad as he’s one of the artistes that I admire. Every time I listen to his music, he connects me with the Heavens,” said Mangena. A member of the Apostolic Faith Church in Southern Africa which had the likes of gospel music greats, the late Brian Sibalo and Freedom Sengwayo, Vusa Mangena released his debut album Nkosi Bambi Sandla Sami in 2018. Last year, the 29-year-old artiste released Silwele, a track that is doing great on radio stations and actual sales. The track which features Vuyo Brown and Snowy, implores God to protect the world from the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. “Silwele is doing wonders. I was so happy to see it being premièred on Trace Gospel. From it, I made a lot of sales. The song is a prayer to God asking him to fight for us and gives us victory over this pandemic. “I sing the song every day when praying and I get emotional.”
