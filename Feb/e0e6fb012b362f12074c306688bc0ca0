ZIFA has been urged to set age limits for players in the lower division leagues so that they become strictly development platforms. Lower divisions, especially Division One, have become a retirement home for players that would have been discarded by topflight clubs. Some coaches in Division One find that experienced players offer them the backbone they need to challenge for the championship and hence opt for experience instead of development. There’s, however, a growing feeling that lower leagues should be reserved for player development, according to Division One side CIWU coach Kudzayi Mhandire. “If possible, let’s have age limits in the lower leagues so that they are fully used for player development. I’m appealing to Zifa to step in and set an age limit for the lower leagues, as there is no relevance or merit to have a 35-year-old player in Division One. Division One must be a developmental league for the Premier Soccer League,” said Mhandire. “Our football is not going anywhere because you’re promoted to the PSL with a 35-year-old and yet average age in the PSL is 28. In the end it comes back to bite you, meaning development wise we are not growing.” The country’s junior football development system has raised dust in the past few years following poor performances by junior national teams. Many believe Zimbabwe has immense talent at junior level, but Zifa is not investing enough in football development. — @innocentskizoe
