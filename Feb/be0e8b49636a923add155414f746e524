The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Premier Soccer League plans to embark on an ambitious programme of importing recommended Covid-19 vaccines for players and officials as moves for the return of football in the country gather pace. Local football has been in limbo since March 2020 when the Government imposed a national lockdown in a move aimed at curtailing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic that has now claimed millions of lives worldwide. According to the latest stats, 1 316 people have succumbed to Covid-19 in Zimbabwe. In a leaked document titled Proposals for the start of 2021 Football Season, PSL chief executive officer Kennedy Ndebele said the World Health Organisation together with respective governments around the world are recommending vaccination as a solution to curbing or minimising Covid-19. “The PSL will seek application to get clearance from the Ministry of Health (and Child Care) to import recommended vaccines for all the players and officials. The process of vaccination will be carried out by the PSL medical committee doctors. All guidelines regarding vaccination to be strictly followed by all stakeholders,” wrote Ndebele. The document that has vast proposals, was sent to all 18 PSL governors. Last week Fifa president Gianni Infantino said footballers should not be considered among the priority groups for receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, leaving organisations like the PSL with no option but to source the vaccines themselves.
