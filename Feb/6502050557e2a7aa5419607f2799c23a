The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo-Ndlovu, Chronicle Reporter CABINET has approved the National Disability Policy which seeks to address the marginalisation and discrimination of Persons with Disabilities in Zimbabwe and empower them to improve their quality of life. The policy was crafted as measure to assist in domesticating provisions of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which Zimbabwe ratified. It is estimated that about 1,4 million people have some form of disability in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe was one of the first countries to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2013 and remain one of the few countries in Africa with legislation that specifically caters for people with disabilities. By domesticating the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the country would have moved together with other progressive countries in putting disability on the national agenda. The disability policy will ensure that facilities such as ramps, for those on wheelchairs and Braille for the visually impaired among other disabled friendly facilities are found in public places Presenting a post-Cabinet media briefing yesterday, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said the policy had been approved. “The National Disability Policy seeks to address the marginalization and discrimination of Persons with Disabilities empower them to improve their own quality of life and enable them to contribute towards the national development agenda. It sets standards for the inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in all facets of life, thereby serving as an overarching policy framework on disability across all sectors, including the public, private and development sectors. Approval of the policy will pave way for the drafting of the Bill in line with the country’s Constitution,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. @thamamoe
