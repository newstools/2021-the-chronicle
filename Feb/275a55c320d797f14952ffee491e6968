The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent VALENTINE’s Day was not going to pass by without Msiz’kay, the Ngawuzw’umoya Wami hit-maker singing his heart out. Always trying something new, the rapper took an RnB soulful path with his latest celebration of love single, Ngisemathandweni that he released on Friday, two days before the day to celebrate love. From the beginning of the song, Msiz’kay declares his undying love to his loved one. “Ngifuna ukubhala ibizo lakho es’bhakabhakeni, ngikhwel’intaba, ngitshel’wonk’umuntu ukuthi Ngisemathandweni,” he sings. It is a basic song whose lyrics can be sung along without any difficulty. The more you play the song, the more you fall in love with it. In the song, Msiz’kay also brings out the love sick puppy in every person who is in love where they can make outlandish promises such as going to get the sun. The song was accompanied by a music video that is plain and simple as well. It was centred on a guy taking his woman out on a surprise date at some mountainous place. He blindfolds her and when he reveals his surprise, Msiz’kay shows off a band that is ready to perform for his date. The woman looks intrigued and impressed by the romantic gesture. While the band is playing with Msiz’kay singing, there will be someone on the side painting, in fact, writing Ngisemathandweni, while the lady watches in glee. However, at the end of the music video, one is left thinking that more could have been done as more scenes could have been added. But perhaps in these Covid-19 times, money to do some production gymnastics is simply not there. Possibly this explains why Msiz’kay decided to do a linear storyline.
