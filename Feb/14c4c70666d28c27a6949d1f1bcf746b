TRADITIONAL leaders have said the country is on course towards achieving food sufficiency following good rains being received in most parts of the country despite some crops being waterlogged. The chiefs have appealed to Government to provide fertiliser for crops that have been affected by incessant rains. In the past three farming seasons, most families have relied on Government’s aid due successive poor rains which have led to most crops being a write-off. The traditional leaders said the rains have also been good for livestock farmers. Deputy President of the Chiefs Council, Chief Mtshana said villagers who planted early are set to get a bumper harvest while some areas will receive poor yields due to heavy rains. “This farming season will largely depend on when villagers planted their crops. Those who planted early are set to get a bumper harvest but some areas have been affected by the rains as some crops have become waterlogged. Those who took up Pfumvudza/Intwasa programme are set to get better yields as they planted early but those who planted later may not get a good harvest as their crops were affected by the rains and they did not get fertiliser on time,” said Chief Mtshana. “However, in terms of a proper crop assessment situation, Agritex is on the ground and is likely to come up with an informed decision on the situation on the ground.” He urged Government to expedite distribution of fertiliser so that some farmers could salvage some of their crops following the heavy rains. Chief Mtshana said some of the villagers will still need the Government’s grain relief aid although the figures will be lower than in the past three seasons. He said the situation was promising for livestock farmers as pastures were good while most water bodies are full. Chief Mabhikwa from Lupane, Matabeleland North, said Government had done well in providing inputs to farmers and promoting the Pfumvudza/Intwasa concept which was widely embraced by communities. <img class="wp-image-531514 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/chi-mabhikwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/chi-mabhikwa.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/chi-mabhikwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Mabhikwa “Therefore, in most areas we are anticipating a bumper harvest as a result of the climate proof programme. In some areas some people have started harvesting their crops. But the heavy rains we are receiving could damage some of our crops. We appeal to the Government to facilitate for farmers to receive ammonium nitrate fertiliser as some of the crops are showing signs of distress due to the rains that we are continuously receiving,” said Chief Mabhikwa. Chief Masendu from Bulilima District in Matabeleland South said the torrential rains were dampening what would have been a bumper harvest. “I have been doing my assessments, I think a lot of people will get better yields this year compared to the past seasons. I think we have to be grateful and appreciate that this year will be an improved farming season. But one of the biggest challenges is that of access to fertiliser because with the amounts of rains being received, fertiliser would have played an important role in saving some of the crops. But only a few people received the fertiliser,” said Chief Masendu. He said some farmers were also losing livestock due to rain related cattle diseases as they cannot afford to vaccinate their animals. <img class="wp-image-531515 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/chi-masendu.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/chi-masendu.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/chi-masendu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Chief Masendu Chief Dakamela from Nkayi in Matabeleland North said due to different landscapes there are some villagers in his area who will record a bumper harvest while others are not going to get much due to waterlogging. He said compared with the three past seasons, he believes more people in his area will be food secure and would not require to be on the Government’s relief programme. “But there are others who would still need the assistance as some of the crops were affected by the rains. Some of the farming inputs such as fertiliser were not distributed on time. But also, there are some people who did not plant at all so those ones will remain dependent on the Government’s food aid programme,” he said. — @nqotshili
