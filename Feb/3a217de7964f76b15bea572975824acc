LAMONTVILLE Golden Arrows FC might have lost the Nedbank Cup derby clash 5-4 to Amazulu on penalties, but Zimbabwean striker Knox Mutizwa’s fine form cannot be ignored. Mutizwa provided an assist to Michael Gumede with a perfectly calculated defence-splitting pass as Arrows raced into the lead on Saturday before an injury time equaliser by Lehlohonolo Majoro forced the match to be decided by penalties. Zimbabwean defensive midfielder Danny Phiri, who is still finding his feet after a long injury lay-off, missed one of Arrows’ spot kicks. Left-back Divine Lunga had a good game, but it is Mutizwa whose recent performances seem to be intentionally “bleeping” national team coach Zdravko Logarusic. With slightly over a month before the Warriors continue their quest for a berth in the Africa Cup of Nations, Loga is sweating over the availability of key players Khama Billiat and skipper Knowledge Musona. The forwards are racing against time for fitness ahead of the decisive qualifiers next month following injuries they picked up last month. Musona is recovering from a knee injury, while Billiat cracked his leg bone and has only just returned to the gym for some light exercise. Musona, who was initially expected to have started light training, remains in the treatment room. Mutizwa, who was overlooked for the back-to-back Afcon qualifiers against Algeria last year, has been making noise with decent performances in the 13 outings he’s had for Arrows. Having established himself as a vital player at Arrows, who are fourth on the South African Premiership log, Mutizwa has two goals and two assists. The former Bosso forward finished the 2019/20 season on 13 goals, three shy of Frank Hellings “Gabadinho” Mhango of Orlando Pirates and Peter Shalulile of Highlands Park, who bagged 16 goals apiece to share the golden boot award.
