The Chronicle Lady Gaga has offered a US$500 000 (more than R7m) reward for the safe return of her two French bulldogs after they were stolen during an attack on her dog-walker. The multiple award-winning artiste’s dog-walker was shot with a semi-automatic handgun before the male suspect took off with the dogs, Gustav and Koji. It is unknown whether the assault was random or motivated because of Gaga’s celebrity status. A possible explanation reportedly provided by authorities is that the assault is part of a crime syndicate targeting the breed because of their high value, after a series of attacks to steal French bulldogs. – BBC.
