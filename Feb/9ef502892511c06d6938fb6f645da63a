Organisers for the Star FM Listeners’ Choice Awards 2021 are calling on artistes to submit their works for the forthcoming awards with all winners set to be chosen by the public on various voting platforms. The awards which will be held virtually on March 13 are all about appreciating Zimbabwean artistes’ works especially during this difficult time of the Covid-19 pandemic. Star FM head of programming, Steve Vickers, confirmed the latest developments saying the awards will run under the RespectTheHustle hash tag. “Our hashtag is ‘RespectTheHustle’. It was a tough year but so much good music was released and we saw artistes embracing the new normal through online shows and continuing to record music. “We are thankful to our musicians for what they have done and continue to do in uplifting the nation in these challenging times,” Vickers said. He said there will be 16 categories for this year’s awards and encouraged artistes to start submitting their music for consideration. “All the winners will be decided by a public vote on our platforms. Artistes are allowed to enter their music from now up to February 18 on our website – www.starfmmusicawards.co.zw. “The shortlisted entries will be published this month.” He added that the awards are all about inspiring musicians, corporate world and fans to take music as a serious business.
