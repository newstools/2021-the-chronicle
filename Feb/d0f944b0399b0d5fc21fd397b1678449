The Chronicle Judge Jarachara, Chronicle Reporter Members of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) on Wednesday spruced up the Bulawayo provincial Heroes Acre in Nkulumane suburb. Soldiers from Bulawayo District’s Imbizo barracks apart from cutting grass and clearing bushes, also planted trees at the provincial shrine as part of the army’s corporate social responsibility programme. Commander Bulawayo District Colonel Ossie Ollie Mhandu said the clean-up was not a once-off thing but a ZNA routine exercise meant to assist communities. “This clean-up is not unique to this year and neither is it a once-off thing but we undertake such an exercise annually as part of the ZNA’s community assistance. Last week on the National Clean-up Day we went to Chief Sigola’s place where we cleaned up public places,” she said. Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association Bulawayo provincial vice chairperson Cde Killion Muvuti expressed gratitude to the military for undertaking such an initiative. He commended the army for not forgetting their departed comrades who sacrificed their lives to liberate the country. “This gesture by the army gladdens my heart. It was a burden we were carrying on our shoulders and we are feeling relieved,” said Cde Muvuti. He said many soldiers were buried at the provincial shrine and it was good for the living soldiers to remember them. Cde Muvuti appealed to the Government to maintain the heroes’ graves saying this responsibility cannot be left to individual families. He also urged the Ministry of Defence and War Veterans Affairs to ensure war veterans are taken care of. “We have Cdes like Cde Hadebe and Cde Jack Mpofu, these guys worked with the late Nikita Mangena and were injured during the war but are struggling to raise money for medication. Some of these war veterans trained our high-profile commanders in the military and some officials in the Government,” said Cde Muvuti. — @jdgjarachara
