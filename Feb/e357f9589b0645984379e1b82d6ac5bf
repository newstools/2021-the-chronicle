The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Cheverons series against Afghanistan initially set for Oman this month has now been rescheduled for Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, at the beginning of next month. The Afghanistan national cricket team does not play its home games in Afghanistan due to the ongoing security situation and lack of international standard facilities in the war-torn country. In a statement, the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) announced that the series will consist of two Tests and three Twenty20 Internationals. “As per the Future Tours Program (FTP), Afghanistan Cricket Board will host Zimbabwe for two Tests and three T20 series which will (be) held from 2nd to 20th March 2021 in UAE. The matches are part of the bilateral series between the two countries. “This is a major series with both teams considered as rivals in the cricket world to face each other again for competitive cricket after some time. The series will ensure that cricket fans witness some great cricket between Afghanistan and Zimbabwe,” the ACB statement reads. The ACB also said it was in search of a title sponsor for the series against Zimbabwe, with February 22 the closing date for showing interest. – @innocentskizoe
