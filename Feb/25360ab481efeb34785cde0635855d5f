The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent A new pageant, Mr and Miss Mental Health that was recently introduced to raise awareness about mental health issues has been shelved by its organisers who have now adopted a wait and see approach following the Covid-19 protocols set up by Government. The pageant that was set up by Sipho Mazibuko was supposed to be held last month, but had to be postponed indefinitely due to the extension of the lockdown and its subsequent tightening. Mr and Miss Mental Health was set to bring together, men and women who are admitted at Ingutsheni Central Hospital as contestants to raise awareness about mental health and also fight stigmatisation. Mazibuko said preparations for the pageant were at an advanced stage before the 30-day lockdown and when it was effected, these plans had to be put on hold. “Before the lockdown came into effect, we held some rehearsals preparing for the pageant that was supposed to be held mid-January. Everything was going well and we had identified some patients who were to be part of the competition. “Now, we have to wait for the restrictions to be lifted,” said Mazibuko. “We’ll conduct a press conference soon to announce the new dates of the pageant. For now, we have to follow the protocols of Government and adhere to the measures that have been put in place for our safety as a nation.” The pageant falls under Mazibuko’s NGO, Mental Voices which aims to fight stigma and denial. Under Mental Voices, Mazibuko successfully hosted Miss Summer Strides after a 13-year hiatus last year. Celine Sialumba (24) was crowned queen at the pageant whose theme was “Creating mental health awareness”.
