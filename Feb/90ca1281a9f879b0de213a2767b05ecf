ZIMBABWEANS locally and in the Diaspora have started mobilising resources to assist a family from Bulilima district in Matabeleland South province whose homestead was torched by a boyfriend of one of the family members. Mr Lewis Phiri aged 108 years and his family were left homeless after all the four huts at their homestead were set ablaze by the angry boyfriend who disappeared soon after the arson. The family members could not salvage anything from the burning huts as the assailant Felix Moyo (25) threatened to kill anyone who dared enter the burning huts. Two WhatsApp groups have since been created in Zimbabwe and in South Africa to coordinate and mobilise resources to assist the family. A Zimbabwean based in Sweden, Mr Tichaona Maphosa has pledged to support the family financially for a year. “What happened is very tragic indeed and we must all do what we can to assist the family. I would like to pledge a monthly support of US$50 for the next one year beginning January. I will also collect clothes from my base and send them though this would take time because of the distance,” said Mr Maphosa. The South African WhatsApp group-Helping Hands Tjinjika, raised 2 000 rand soon after it was created yesterday and more have pledged to donate in cash or kind. Mr Derrick Matobolo Ncube who is coordinating help from South Africa said they will be sending the donations home as they receive them. <img class="wp-image-529437 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/arson.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/arson.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/arson-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Phiri homestead goes up in flames “We really wish to mobilise as much as possible for the family. Once we know what we have, we will make a plan on how to send the donations home. We already have a service for sending money home which Zimbabweans here are using so we have no challenge in sending home cash donations,” said Mr Ncube. A local WhatsApp group- Bulilima Arson Attack has been created and is mobilising resources to also assist the family. Plumtree businessman Mr Bhekisisa Bhebhe who runs Maziwa Farm Produce is coordinating local help and has pledged to donate building materials. “I will be sending a truck with building materials this week to the homestead. I have a number of materials at the farm that can be used to help the family. I appeal to other businesses and the generality of our people to also come on board and change the story of this family. We will be a cursed people if we were to let a 108-year-old man suffer when we could pool resources together and make a difference,” said Mr Bhebhe. Councillor for the area Cllr Nanny Ndlovu said a committee has been formed at the village level to account for received donations. “The story has touched many people and we have been receiving calls from people asking how they can assist. Our immediate plan is to build a hut for the old man. We have tasked local builders to give us a quotation of all that is needed so that we start with the resources that we have,” she said. Cllr Ndlovu said Ministry of Local Government and Public Works officials passed through the homestead on Saturday afternoon. She said there is urgent need to build accommodation for the family that include the arsonist’s girlfiriend, Miss Nobesuthu Nyathi (25) who is expecting. Miss Nyathi said the dispute with her boyfriend was over 40 rand she was paid for plaiting someone’s hair. She said Moyo wanted to spend all the money on beer and she refused as she wanted to use some of the money to buy groceries. — @themkhust
