The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter BINDURA Nickel Mine (BNC) is eying to increase production to more than 60 000 tonnes of ore per month in the second quarter after the re-deepening project at Trojan Mine is completed. The country’s nickel producer revealed this in a trading update for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. During the period under review, BNC produced 116 525 tonnes of ore reflecting a 9 percent increase from 107 036 tonnes produced in 2019 in the comparable period. The increase in ore mined was attributed to the mine’s recovery from the effects of the slow down induced by the Covid-19 lockdown between April and May last year. “In the immediate aftermath of the Re-deepening Project commissioning, production will be ramped up to more than 60 000 tonnes of ore per month, particularly in respect of the mining of disseminated ore. “The company’s operational and financial performance is expected to improve due to the consummation of this critical project,” it said. BNC is not anticipating an improved operational and financial performance for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 due to the planned short production stoppage that is intended to facilitate the Trojan Shaft Re-deepening tie-in Project. – @okazunga
