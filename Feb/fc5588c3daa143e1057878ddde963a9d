National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi yesterday said the operation was ongoing. “The ZRP confirms that 2 615 people were arrested on January 31 for contravening the country’s Covid-19 regulations. One thousand five hundred and thirty-five people were arrested for unnecessary movements while 633 were accounted for in relation to failure to wear face masks,” he said. Ass Comm Nyathi warned violators of the 6PM to 6AM curfew, saying those knocking off at 3PM should go home after work. “Let us all stay safe in order to curb the spread of Covid -19 cases. As police we reiterate that only members of essential services will be allowed passage at roadblocks and other checkpoints after 6PM,” he said. “Members of the public are implored to plan their movements carefully so that they are not inconvenienced during the curfew period.” During the lockdown, people are supposed to be confined to their homes and may only leave to buy basic necessities at a supermarket or food retail store, or fuel or gas at a fuel or gas retail outlet, within a radius not exceeding five kilometres or the nearest establishment if those within the radius are closed. The country has of late witnessed a high number of local infections amid fears that the second wave of the pandemic will be more deadly than the first. <img class="wp-image-440924 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Police-spokesperson-Chief-Superintendent-Paul-Nyathi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Police-spokesperson-Chief-Superintendent-Paul-Nyathi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Police-spokesperson-Chief-Superintendent-Paul-Nyathi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi Ass Comm Nyathi also warned anyone breaching the inter-city travel rules that they will be arrested while vehicles used in illegal services will be impounded. Despite Zupco being the only authorised public transport operator, some pirate kombis and Honda Fit continue to ferry passengers, targeting mostly those who don’t like spending several hours in transport queues. In Bulawayo police recently launched a crackdown dubbed “Etown udingani” targeting violators of the 6PM to 6AM curfew, among other lockdown regulations. They impounded 95 vehicles from motorists, including pirate taxis, for defying the level lockdown regulations meant to curb the spread of Covid-19. – @mashnets
