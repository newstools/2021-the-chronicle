THE Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has announced that its tour of Zimbabwe will start on April 17 for two Tests and three T20Is. The board yesterday released its April schedule, which also includes a series against South Africa in the same month. The ODIs against South Africa will be played on April 2, 4 and 7. Pakistan will also play four T20Is in South Africa. “This will be Pakistan’s second series in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League. After defeating Zimbabwe 2-1 in November 2020, Pakistan are fifth on the table. In contrast, this will be South Africa’s first outing in the league. In the 13-side league, each side has to play eight series over a two-year period, including four at home and four away. “The tour to South Africa was originally planned for October 2020, but was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It has now been rescheduled for April, prior to Pakistan’s two Test and three T20I tour to Zimbabwe, which will commence on 17 April,” wrote the PCB. Ireland was also meant to tour Zimbabwe between March and April but that tour has been cancelled. With Zimbabwe scheduled to face Afghanistan men away and Pakistan men at home, between March and April, ZC said accommodating the Ireland series in between the two aforementioned tours as had been proposed, was unfortunately not going to be feasible. The Chevrons are presently preparing for a series against Afghanistan to be played in Abu Dhabi at the beginning of next month. It will mark the first time Zimbabwe and Afghanistan play each other in Test cricket following the granting of Test status to the Afghans in June 2017. — @innocentskizoe
