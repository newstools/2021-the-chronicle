The Chronicle Prosper Ndlovu, Business Editor KARIBA Hydro-Power Station is now the dominant producer of electricity in the country, generating about 754MW out of the combined output of 1 075MW daily at a time when thermal stations are at their lowest due to coal stock outs and ageing plants. Hwange Power Station, the largest thermal power producer with an installed capacity of 920MW is only producing 293MW, according to the Monday power generation update by the Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC). Bulawayo Thermal Power Station, which has 120MW installed capacity is at zero today while Munyati Thermal, which originally had 120MW capacity is generating only 16MW. Harare Thermal Power Station output has dwindled to 12MW against an installed capacity of 75MW, said ZPC. Zimbabwe is generating about 1 075MW daily compared to estimated demand of 2 200MW, forcing the country to resort to imports to cover the power supply gap. In its latest power update for the 4th quarter of 2020, the ZPC expressed concern over weak output from thermal stations.
