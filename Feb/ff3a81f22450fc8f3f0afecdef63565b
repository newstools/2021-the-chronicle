The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau THE recent upgrading of security by the government at the border with South Africa has helped reduce rent-seeking activities. As a result, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority has been able to collect $13 million and US$120 000 in extra import duties from smugglers in the last 30 days. Prior to the latest Government move to deploy more security personnel, it was estimated that the country was losing US$1 billion annually in potential import duty, owing to smuggling along the Limpopo River. <img class="wp-image-533657 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/commercial-trucks-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/commercial-trucks-3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/commercial-trucks-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Some South African registered commercial trucks which were recently intercepted by security agents after smuggling groceries which had been falsely declared as fertilizer. Zimra’s spokesperson, Mr Francis Chimanda said between January 5 and February 5 this year they made 47 seizures (confiscation of goods) as compared to 22 within the same period last year. “Between January 5 and February 5 last year we recovered duty amounting to $105,664.49 after making 22 seizures and this year during the same period we collected a total of $13,893,920.20 and US$119,236.21 from 47 seizures,” said Mr Chimanda. He said the majority of the goods being smuggled between Zimbabwe and South Africa include groceries, beers, and other alcoholic beverages, chicken cuts, used tyres, various meats, fruits, and building material. Zimra has introduced a 100 percent search initiative on all cargo mostly being carried in light commercial trucks with a carrying capacity of between 15 tonnes and 20 tonnes. <img class="alignnone wp-image-533660 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/commercial-trucks-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/commercial-trucks-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/commercial-trucks-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This followed an upsurge in a trend of false declarations by either the transporters or the importers. Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Minister Kazembe Kazembe said recently that a raft of measures had been employed to address challenges at the border and to combat crime. He said the law enforcement agents would deal decisively with those caught on the wrong side of the law. “With regards to the illegal border crossing, the Government has always been seized with the matter and you will recall that members of the National Security Council visited the border on December 11 last year and toured all the undesignated crossing points. “A decision was then made, hence the deployment of more security and technologies”, said Minister Kazembe. Border, jumpers, smugglers, and other wheeler-dealers have been warned that the security team was ready to deal with them within the confines of the law. Minister Kazembe said they will not tolerate crime along the country’s borders and that there will be no sacred cows. He said it was important for travellers to obtain the necessary documents before embarking on their journeys to avoid unnecessary inconveniences. @tupeyo
