The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Chevrons held their first training session in Abu Dhabi after completing  three days of quarantine ahead of their first Test against Aghanistan next week. The Zimbabwean players all returned negative results in Covid-19 tests conducted. In a statement ZC said: “The excitement among the players and technical staff was palpable and understandably so as Zimbabwe trooped out for their first training session at the Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday, having spent three days locked up in quarantine ahead of their two-match Test series against Afghanistan in the United Arab Emirates capital.” All-rounder Sikandar Raza also expressed delight after the team held its training session. “Great to have our first outdoor session today with Zimbabwe Cricket after three days of quarantine. Great facilities provided by @AbuDhabiCricket for training today. All four Covid tests for everyone came out negative,” Raza said. The two sides are squaring off in Abu Dhabi because Afghanistan does not play at home due to the ongoing security situation in the war-torn country. The first of the two-match Test series begins on March 2, with the second starting on March 10.
