The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter Local boxers that failed to make the cut for the African Boxing Qualification tournament last year have to compete in at least three tournaments to score points to improve their rankings. Zimbabwe Boxing Federation (ZBF) yesterday said it is waiting for clearance from the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) to send boxers with potential to qualify for the Tokyo Olympic Games to three regional competitions in a bid to improve their rankings. The Zimbabwean boxers’ hopes of participating in the final Olympic qualifiers set for June in France were ruined by the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced organisers to cancel the event. Arvian Mathe, ZBF secretary-general, said plans are afoot for at least four boxers to trade leather in Botswana, Zambia and Mozambique before May. “The problem we had is that one of our boxers Ndabezihle Phiri, an African flyweight champion, had his qualification for the Olympics nullified when it was decided that the ranking system be used;  which kicked him out of the top three. This means he and others now have to participate in at least three regional tournaments before the final ranking competition to be held in Tanzania, in May,” said Mathe. Besides Phiri, the other boxers ZBF intends to send for qualifying events are Trade Nkomozabo, Zibusiso Nyoni, Agnes Kwashi, Rudo Maposa and Tendai Tigere. – @ZililoR
