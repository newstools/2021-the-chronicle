The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter Makomo Football club executive has refuted social media reports that the Zifa Southern Region Division One side has disbanded due to financial challenges. There had been rumours that the club, one of the ambitious sides with sound sponsorship from mining company Makomo Resources, had been disbanded due to alleged viability challenges that saw some employees being laid off as a cost containment measure. There was a spontaneous demo at the company premises as employees pushed for a living wage. Club chairman Mernard Mayera said all was well at the club and reports of folding up were untrue. “Makomo FC is still being funded by Makomo Resources and reports that the football club has folded are not true,” said Mayera. Makomo is one of four Division One clubs domiciled in Hwange, with the other three being Hwange, bankrolled by Hwange Colliery Company,  power utility side ZPC Hwange as well as army side Motomoto.
