THE Level Four Covid-19 lockdown was yesterday extended by another two weeks with schools remaining closed during that period. Curfew hours will now run from 8PM to 5.30AM while businesses are allowed to operate from 8AM to 5PM. The Ministry of Health and Child Care is set to increase Covid-19 testing with private companies seeking to resume operations required to test their employees in compliance with the World Health Organisation (WHO) protocols. Courts will only open to deal with urgent cases and those attending hearings must undergo Covid-19 testing. However, no one will be allowed to sit in the court gallery. The informal sector will be allowed to reopen subject to meeting WHO protocols. Intercity and interprovincial travel and social and public gatherings remain banned with funeral gatherings still restricted to 30 people. <img class="wp-image-532047 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/batch.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/batch.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/batch-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Mnangagwa and Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Guo Shaochum exchange certificates of the Covid-19 vaccine donated by China to Zimbabwe at State House in Harare yesterday The new regulations were announced by President Mnangagwa in an address to the nation yesterday. The President noted that while the national lockdown goals are now within reach, the numbers of active cases and deaths are however still high hence the need to bring them down further. “I wish to update you on the current state of the national Covid-19 pandemic as we revisit the lockdown that we introduced at the beginning of the year and hence map a way forward. Since the implementation of the current lockdown, which ends midnight today, we have witnessed a marked decrease in the number of Covid-19 infections and deaths,” he said. “Every life lost is a big loss to us. I therefore, extend the national lockdown by further two weeks. The extension will allow the number of active cases and those still in incubation to recede.” The President said the lockdown extension should result in a great reduction in the pool of infected people, enable health personnel to investigate and monitor the presence and circulation of new variants. “The new measures will operate as follows; hours of business will be from 8AM to 5PM, curfew is from 8PM to 5.30AM, no intercity and interprovincial commuting, funeral gatherings remain pegged at 30 people with all social gatherings remaining banned,” he said. “All burials are handled according to WHO regulations. Essential services to remain functional, Government manning levels to increase from 10 percent to 25 percent. All private companies seeking resumption of operations should test their employees in compliance with WHO protocols and the judiciary will open for only urgent cases to be heard.” President Mnangagwa said schools will remain closed for the duration of the lockdown extension. “Our markets shall remain open but observing social distancing and those in the informal sector may open once they have satisfied WHO protocols,” he said. The President also thanked China for donating 200 000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines, which arrived in the country yesterday. “As I address you, our nation this morning (yesterday) received first consignment of vaccines from the People’s Republic of China. Let me thank the Chinese government for this gesture of great humanity. We will forever remain grateful to the Chinese government and people for standing with us,” he said. “I am also happy that the second consignment of vaccines procured from China will be received in a few weeks’ time.” President Mnangagwa said vaccines from other countries which include Russia, India and the United Kingdom, are also on the way. “That should see our pace of vaccinating willing Zimbabweans increase in tempo thus drawing us nearer the goal of achieving herd immunity. “The ultimate goal is a return to our normal lives so that our children can go back to school, and that we all resume our collective effort towards recovery and growing our economy for the realisation of Vision 2030,” he said. “Let us take this opportunity to remind you to remain vigilant, focused and to continue to adhere to all the lockdown measures. The health of our nation depends on us all.”- @mashnets
