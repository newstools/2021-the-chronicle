The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) has announced that former captain Rashid Khan is a doubt ahead of their Test series against Zimbabwe, which begins next Tuesday. According to the ACB, the leg-spinner is battling a finger injury and is presently undergoing treatment. “National team’s spin-bowler Rashid Khan is likely to miss first Test match between Afghanistan and Zimbabwe due to a finger injury on his bowling arm,” read a statement from ACB. “Khan was injured during his stint in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) where he played for Lahore Qalandars Franchise. Meanwhile, Rashid Khan is under treatment by the relevant health officials in UAE and the final call on his inclusion in the first Test will be taken after a reassessment of his injury on 28th February.” The Afghanistan Test squad for the Zimbabwe series features a host of new faces, with Abdul Malik, Munir Ahmad Kakar, Shahidullah Kamal, Bahir Shah Mohboob, Fazal Haq Farooqi, Saleem Safi and Zia Ur Rahman Akbar all without a Test cap to their names. Sayed Ahmad Shirzad also has no Test experience, but the medium pacer has featured in two ODIs and four T20Is since his debut in early 2019.
