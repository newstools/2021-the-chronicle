The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter The Covid-19 Special Board Committee has green-lighted the resumption of football in the country and their recommendations now await consent of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Minister Kirsty Coventry. A highly placed source told Chronicle Sport that the committee comprising the Sports and Recreation Commission  board, management, epidemiologists and experts in pandemic management and containment, including sports administration, had resolved that football returns, but the final call will be made by Minister Coventry. <img class="wp-image-480190 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Kirsty-Coventry8.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Kirsty-Coventry8.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/Kirsty-Coventry8-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kirsty Coventry “The document is now with Minister Coventry, but the committee has agreed that football returns. It also put across some recommendations which have to be met by the applicant, which in this case is Zifa, but suffice to say we are good to go in as far as football return is concerned,” said the source. SRC acting director/general Sebastian Garikai could neither confirm nor deny the development when contacted by Chronicle Sport on Monday morning. “Look it’s a holiday today so offices are closed; all I can re-affirm is that the application by Zifa was indeed received and it followed due process. Maybe during the week we might be able to have a formal position,” said Garikai.
