The Chronicle Midlands Bureau Chief TM Group of companies has scored a first by introducing a legal aid service product for individuals and corporates under its Clientsure Legal Aid insurance unit. Clientsure is a new company under TM Group of companies, which is into agriculture, real estate development and micro-finance, among others. Clientsure public relations director, Mr Nyasha Gonese, said the new business was coming at a time when over 70 percent of Zimbabweans are uninsured. The company offers micro-insurance services to the informal sector covering both immovable and movable properties, said Mr Gonese in an interview. “We offer microfinance and legal aid insurance products that include hospital cash-back plans and funeral plans. Due to the hard-economic conditions, some of our people are losing property because they can’t be represented in court,” he said. Mr Gonese said Clientsure was keen to work closely with the business community, especially in the informal sector, who should enjoy benefits of their hard work. “The huge difference we have with the existing insurance companies is that we have decided to come in and cut the gap, filling the insurance gap. Right now, only those formally employed are in one way or the other insured and not the informal sector whom we are targeting,” he said. Mr Gonese said those engaged in construction projects and home owners need insurance cover to protect their investments from uncertainties. “Any person in need of mortgage insurance or micro insurance or anyone buying a stand needs to be insuring the house in case anything happens,” he said. “We are also looking at paying subscriptions for the houses in case the member dies and the liability ends there. This insurance will cover your family.” “We believe that people and companies should be covered now. Insurance should be playing a huge part now.” Mr Gonese said Clientsure was also preparing a package to cover clients affected the Covid-19 pandemic.
