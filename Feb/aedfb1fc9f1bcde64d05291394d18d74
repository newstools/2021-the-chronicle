The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter POLICE in Bulawayo have arrested a 21-year-old domestic worker from Bradfield suburb for allegedly sexually abusing her employer’s 10-year-old son. In a Twitter statement, the police urged parents and guardians to be wary of people they are leaving their children with as some of them are abusive. “The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) encourages parents to always monitor their children whilst playing and avoid leaving them with irresponsible persons as they might end up being abused. This follows a case of aggravated indecent assault which occurred on Saturday in Bradfield, Bulawayo where a male juvenile (10) was sexually abused by a housemaid (21),” read the statement. Meanwhile, a teenager from Harare was raped by a 33-year-old after being told by a self-proclaimed prophet that the rapist would be her husband. “Harare woman (19) was raped on several occasions between January and February 2021 by a suspect (33) after receiving a prophetic message from an alleged prophet who indicated to her that the man will be her future husband. The spiritualist concealed the offence when it was reported to him by the victim,” read the police statement. “The ZRP encourages members of the public to report all cases of sexual abuse promptly and avoid trusting strange prophetic utterances from pastors and prophets.” -@nqotshili
