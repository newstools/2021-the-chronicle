The Chronicle The Royal Moroccan Football Federation have explained why Kaizer Chiefs will not be allowed to enter the country for their CAF Champions League Group C match against Wydad Athletic. Chiefs have been denied entry visas into Morocco despite having made the required applications and booking of all flights and accomodation for their stay. Amakhosi were scheduled to kick-off their maiden Champions League group stage campaign this Saturday evening (21h00 SA time) against Wydad in Casablanca. The Soweto giants were set to jet out of South Africa on Wednesday evening but had to postpone their flights to Thursday after no response was received relating to their visa applications. The RMFF have since released a statement clarifying their stance over their refusal to allow Chiefs into the country, stating that it was due to health and safety measures by the national government. It has also been revealed that a letter was sent to the competiton’s organising body Confederation of African Football (CAF) requesting a fixture postponement or playing the match in an alternative country. “The Royal Moroccan Football Federation sent a letter to the CAF Clubs Committee informing it that the Moroccan authorities decided not to allow the Wydad Casablanca match with the South African Kaizer Chiefs team to be held on February 13th in Casablanca for the first round of the African Champions League, due to health and safety related to the recent developments of Covid-19,” read a statement from the RMFF. “The Royal Moroccan Football Federation called on the Confederation of African Football to postpone the match, or hold it in another country if this is not possible.” Chiefs are now set to cancel their flights and accomodation booking and will likely incur the financial losses thereof, subject to a final decision from CAF. – KickOff
