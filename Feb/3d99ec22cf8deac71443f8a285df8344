The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS celebrate 95 years of existence this year, and it’s that colorful history and how it has been preserved over the years that Sanctuary Insurance chose to partner with Bosso. The partnership between Highlanders and Sanctuary was sealed on Friday at the Bosso offices. As part of their partnership with Bosso, Sanctuary Insurance has already refurbished and re-branded the Highlanders Toyota Coaster team bus, the official bus for the junior teams. The bus also has all its insurance and road licence costs paid by Sanctuary. Furthermore, Sanctuary Insurance has paid insurance for Bosso’s three other office vehicles. Highlanders gets 30 percent from all insurance members pay using Sanctuary. Sanctuary Insurance managing director Patrick Kusikwenyu said they were pleased by the Highlanders structures, which he believes create possibilities for social clubs to become corporate entities. “We are proud to partner with Highlanders, a club that is a great example of how clubs can become corporate entities. In looking at the history of the club and how it is run, we settled for Bosso as the club that suits our brand,” said Kusikwenyu. “The structures that we found here at Highlanders would make all of us envious. As Sanctuary we pride ourselves as a company that is wholly Zimbabwean and we also take pride in time we have been in business. We decided that we have to be seen with giants that are still running such as Highlanders. “The value lost in not having fans in our stadia makes us think of other ways of using the brands that we have created over the years to create an income stream, hence we have come up with this partnership. We invite all Highlanders’ members and supporters to partner us in this project. Sanctuary Insurance has in the past partnered with Zimbabwe Cricket and sponsored Old Hararians Sports Club as well as the Beitbridge half marathon. – @innocentskizoe
