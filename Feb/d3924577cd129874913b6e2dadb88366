The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter THE Hwange Thermal Power Station expansion project is behind schedule at 58,29 percent as at the end of the fourth quarter ended 31 December 2020 against a target of 78,5 percent. The US$1,5 billion expansion project, which entails the addition of Units 7 and 8  has a January 2022 deadline. Initially, Unit 7 was expected to start firing by April this year while Unit 8 later. It is hoped that the coming on board of Units 7 and 8 would see the power plant, which at present has an installed capacity of 920MW, producing an additional 600MW to the national grid. The Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) said in its latest update that the expansion works were behind schedule mainly due to the adverse impact of Covid-19 pandemic and outstanding Interim Payment Certificate (IPC) by China Exim Bank. “At the end of the quarter, construction of the Hwange 7 and 8 expansion project was at 58,29 percent against a target of 78,5 percent, yielding an unfavourable variance of 17,51 percent. “This was mainly attributed to the Covid 19 pandemic and the outstanding IPC payments on the 85 percent by China Exim Bank,” said the power company. Due to aging equipment, which result in constant breakdowns, Hwange Thermal Power Station is currently producing less than 300MW. – @okazunga
