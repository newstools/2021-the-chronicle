The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA has started the process of inviting national team players that will do duty for the Warriors in next month’s Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers, with the provisional squad set to be announced during the week. Zimbabwe will play two crucial matches against Botswana and Zambia next month. The Warriors are second in the qualifiers’ Group H with five points from four games and will be away to third-placed Botswana in the first match on March 22. On March 30, Zimbabwe will play host to Zambia at the National Sports Stadium. Chipolopolo takes on African champions Algeria, who top Group H with 10 points, on March 22. Wellington Mupandare, the Warriors’ manager said: “We started the process of inviting players by writing to their clubs last week. This was done to avoid a situation where after we’ve announced the squad you hear that certain players are unavailable. It has happened in the past and now we’ve sent invites early to avoid such situations.” – @ZililoR
