The Chronicle KAIZER Chiefs forward Khama Billiat is set for a return to the pitch, according to the club‘s progress update. Billiat suffered a leg fracture last month and has missed his side’s last six DStv Premiership fixtures. The Zimbabwean international’s initial prognosis meant he would be out for two months and a progress update from the club suggests he is well on course to recovery. “Three and half weeks into his injury, Khama has started gym exercises and is now out of the boot,” said Chiefs in a statement on social media. Amakhosi are set to host GladAfrica Championship outfit Richards Bay FC in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 on Sunday and also Siyabonga Ngezana ruled out through suspension. Coach Gavin Hunt further stated that Ramahlwe Mphahlele continues to struggle in his recovery from a hamstring injury, but will undergo a late fitness test 24 hours before the fixture to determine whether he can return to action. “Rama is obviously still struggling with his hamstring, so we’re going to have to see. We’ve still got one or two more days so, we’ll see how fit he is come Sunday, or more on Saturday than Sunday,” said Hunt in his pre-match press conference. — KickOff
