The Chronicle Sports Reporter ASC Jaraaf 1-0 FC Platinum FC Platinum were yesterday bundled out of the Caf Confederation Cup after losing to Jaraaf FC of Senegal by one goal to nil in a play-off in Dakar yesterday. Gallantly as they may have fought, the Zvishavane side were ejected from the tournament on a 2-0 aggregate loss after losing the reverse fixture by a similar margin at the National Sports Stadium in Harare last week. The platinum miners rued the flurry of chances they created and failed to convert in the first-leg in which they fell to a sucker punch 70th minute tap-in away goal by Albert Diene. So wasteful were FC Platinum that Silas Songani even missed a penalty, giving themselves a mountain to climb in Dakar. That mountain proved too much of an ask to climb and yesterday’s loss marked FC Platinum’s exit from all Caf club competitions. They had been demoted to the Caf Confederation Cup from the Caf Champions League after being humiliated by Simba SC of Tanzania in controversial circumstances when five of their key players were declared Covid-19 positive on the morning of their crucial tie in Dar es Salaam. They were thrashed 4-0 and dumped out of Africa’s premier club competition 4-1 on aggregate after failing to protect their 1-0 home win in the first-leg.
