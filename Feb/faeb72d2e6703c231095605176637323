RWANDAN airline (RwandAir) has suspended flights into Southern Africa citing the prevalence of the Covid-19 variants in the region. Before the suspension of the flights, the Rwandan airline was flying into Zimbabwe, South Africa and Zambia. “In view of the global concerns on Covid-19 variants prevalent throughout Southern Africa, RwandAir announces the suspension of its flights to Johannesburg, Capetown, Lusaka and Harare effective February 8, 2021,” it said in a statement, adding that the scheduled flights would resume once there was clarity on the situations. “We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused. Affected customers can rebook and fly at a later date at no additional cost or request a refund.” The Covid-19 pandemic has become a major threat to the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) economies. The bloc’s chair and Mozambique President Mr Filipe Jacinto Nyusi recently expressed worry over rising Covid-19 cases as the region was accounting for more than 50 percent of all new daily infections in Africa. He noted that the world has witnessed a worrying situation as a result of the increase in new infections caused ultimately by a new strain of coronavirus with higher potential of transmissibility. — @okazunga.
