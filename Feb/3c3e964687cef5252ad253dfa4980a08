AMAKHOSI Studios in partnership with Skyz Metro FM has successfully identified teenage radio broadcasters as part of its programme to groom and empower budding broadcasters. Last year a call was made for parents to take their children to Amakhosi Studios (formerly Amakhosi Cultural Centre) for the competition and a total of 125 participated. Only 17 were shortlisted to showcase their broadcasting talent through eight-minute sets. <img class="wp-image-531071 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/maybongwe.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/maybongwe.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/maybongwe-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mayibongwe Zulu Four judges were called in to adjudicate and the final top six young broadcasters were selected. Those selected are Marvelous M Mpofu and Francisca M (teen seniors between 17 and 19 years), Thabiso Jubane and Mayibongwe Zulu (teen juniors between 14 and 16 years) and Bhekumuzi Dube and Sinikiwe Ngwenya (teen okhekhe, 14 years and below). They will now be part of a show, Yisikhathi Sethu, Umkhulu Lomsebenzi that is set to be broadcast on Skyz Metro FM on a date yet to be announced. <img class="wp-image-531073 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/franscisca.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/franscisca.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/franscisca-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Francisca M Amakhosi Studios executive chairman, Cont Mhlanga said the programme is meant to unleash broadcasting talent at a tender age. “We’d like to congratulate the six and call upon all those who wish to partner or sponsor the programme to contact us. So far, we’ve managed to secure a Texas-based website sponsor who’s working on securing prizes for the winners. “The six are set to be adopted into the KeYona Education programmes,” said Mhlanga. <img class="wp-image-531074 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/thabiso1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/thabiso1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/thabiso1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Thabiso Jubane He said empowering youngsters was not a new concept as Amakhosi has been doing that for years. “For Amakhosi, this is not a new project because in 1985 we had the Amakhosi Children’s programme which groomed the likes of Lewis Ndlovu (Drums of Peace) and Amabhoza among others. Dreams to Fame which was held under Amakhosi Cultural Centre also founded Friday Live that gave children a professional feel of the entertainment, arts and culture industry,” said Mhlanga. <img class="wp-image-531077 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/bhekumuzi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/bhekumuzi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/bhekumuzi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bhekumuzi Dube Also eyeing young talent is Skyz Metro FM with the radio station’s chief executive officer, Godwin Phiri saying the aim of this programme is to promote youngsters and community broadcasting. “Yisikhathi Sethu is open to children from all wards in Bulawayo and areas surrounding the city within the radio station’s frequency. The participants are be expected to develop their slots to address the grievances unique to their wards, promote music or artistes from their wards and give coverage to their ward,” Phiri said. <img class="wp-image-531078 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/marvee.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/marvee.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/marvee-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Marvelous M Mpofu He added: “From January to March each year, six children, three boys and three girls will be selected to participate in a broadcasting season under three categories teen seniors (17-19), teen juniors (14-16) and teen okhekhe (13 and younger).
