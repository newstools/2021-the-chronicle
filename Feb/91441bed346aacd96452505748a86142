The Chronicle Chronicle Reporter ONE of the leading long-distance luxury passenger bus carrier, Greyhound, is shutting down operations citing viability challenges emanating from a prolonged lockdown that has resulted in a decline in travel. Greyhound, a South Africa based company has been plying several domestic and regional routes including the Zimbabwe- South Africa one, for the past 37 years. The company announced the latest development on Wednesday, bringing an end to a business that ran for almost four decades. In a statement, the bus company said it will operate until 14 February and those who purchased tickets before the day should be able to get their refunds. “Greyhound and Citiliner are closing operations. Services will run until 14 February 2021. Passengers with tickets booked for services after this date will be refunded. For assistance with refunds, contact Call Centre: 087 352 0352 or email: refunds@greyhound.co.za,” read the statement. Greyhound’s routes covered all parts of South Africa including carrying cross-border passengers to Zimbabwe as well as Mozambique on a daily basis. The services were suspended following the closure of borders by Zimbabwe and South Africa as part of lockdowns regulations to curb the spread of Covid-19. The news of the permanent closure of operations by Greyhound was received with mixed reactions by social media users. Some people took to Twitter to express sadness. @shepherdmpofu tweeted: “Sad development. You transported people. I used your service less than ten times. You gave a terrible service to Zimbabwe where only old buses were allocated. Some had coaches.” @Boohle_Mzizi tweeted: “This feels like a breakup. Greyhound has been literally the best thing that happened to S.A in terms of buses. Their services dawg (sic).” @ZuayNkunzi said: “Yoh used to enjoy the luxury section upstairs, in the very front seats, beautiful, comfort, watching the nature and reading books, long distance travels will never be the same.”
