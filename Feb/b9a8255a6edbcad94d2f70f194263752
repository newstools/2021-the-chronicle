POLICE have added a second charge of murder on a Lupane man who allegedly doused his grandparents’ house with petrol before setting it alight, as a second victim died. Seven people were sleeping in the three-roomed house in Mpofu village when Kholwani Donga (26) from the same area set it alight after accusing his grandparents Robert Donga (75) and his wife Ms Angela Mpala (52) of witchcraft. Donga was last week charged with one count of murder following the death of his grandfather in intensive care unit (ICU) at Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo as a result of the burns, and six counts of attempted murder of his grandmother, paternal aunt, three nieces and a domestic worker. The domestic worker, Praymore Sibanda (19) had been in the ICU at Mpilo following the fire but died on Monday night, five days after the old man’s death. The late Donga was Mpofu village head. He died at the same hospital last Wednesday due to severe burns and was buried last Saturday. According to State papers, Praymore died on Monday and a second charge of murder has been pressed on Donga, who now faces two murder charges and five counts of attempted murder. Donga who recently appeared before Lupane resident magistrate Mr Ndumo Masuku was remanded in custody to April 1. He is yet to appear for the second murder charge. Prosecutors allege Donga poured petrol on the house’s doors before setting it alight just after midnight last week Tuesday. Ms Ayanda Donga (23), three nieces Bandile Donga (8), Buhle Hadebe (10) and Andile Hadebe (7) were sleeping in a spare bedroom and escaped through the window with no injuries while Praymore got burnt when he escaped through the main door which had been burnt down.-@ncubeleon.
