FOLLOWING her hit single, Emathandweni which hit gold in South Africa after selling more than 500 000 digital copies, DJ Zandimaz has released another song For Me featuring a 17-year-old vocalist Michel from Victoria Falls which promises to top the charts. The music video of the Amapiano track was shot in Victoria Falls and will be released today on all digital platforms.
For Me was written by Rodney of Making Ginger and produced by Chuchu of Danica Studios in Chinotimba, Victoria Falls. “The song is about a person missing their lover and hopefully will see them soon. So, on Friday we are dropping the song. We shot the music in Victoria Falls and it’s a Zimbabwean collaboration. The song is already on heavy rotation in South Arica,” said DJ Zandimaz. She said the three artistes reached out to her and she believed in them. “They found me, Michel Chuchu and Ceejay. They are all so young, fresh, light, humble and talented. I just felt so drawn to them. Something in me just ticked and I knew we were meant to be,” said DJ Zandi Maz. She said the whole music video was a collaborative process. “I’d like to give credit to Sozinio the designer who made me look so pretty and fabulous on the music video, Breeze FM who helped in the production process,” said DJ Zandi Maz. Last year, DJ Zandimaz worked with renowned vocalist Nokwazi in the hit Amapiano track, Emathandweni that received heavy rotation and was one of the December dance tracks. The Esigodini-born DJ has played alongside South Africa’s Busiswa, Trademark, DJ Pepsi, Maphorisa and Uhuru among other Mzansi artistes. – Follow on Twitter @bonganinkunzi
