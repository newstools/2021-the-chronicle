The Chronicle Showbiz Correspondent Comedian Mai TT claims a South Africa based promoter Royce Mapaike duped her of performance fees alongside Trevor Dongo, Jah Signal and Enzo Ishall. It seems that Mai TT was booked by Mapaike for a series of shows in South Africa by Mapaike’s Exquisite Entertainment and she claims her and Trevor Dongo filled both VIP areas. According to posters on Exquisite Entertainment’s Facebook page, there was a Valentines Dinner in Capetown this past Saturday and the second a Valentine’s Family Braai Out in Randburg on Sunday. <img class="wp-image-517679 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Trevor-Dongo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Trevor-Dongo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Trevor-Dongo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Trevor D However, Mai TT claims Mapaike after the show vanished into thin air along with their performance fees. She appealed to her over 300 000 followers on Facebook to help find the promoter who she describes as bogus. “Help us find this Bogus Promoter Roy Mapaike his phone number is +27842253475. Arikuhaya maArtists oitisa mashows, oita mari apedza otiza asina kubhadhara mari (He hires artistes for shows and after the show is done and makes his money, disappears without paying the artiste). “As I’m talking to you now akaunza Trevor Dongo neni (and I) inini ndakapiwa (I was given) half before ndauya because I told him handisimuke pasina deposit (I told hm that I don’t travel without a deposit.).”
Mai TT added that Mapaike ran away with her performance fees. Mufunge mashows ese takazadza zvese nekuVIP asi soon after show Roy Mapaike akatiza nemariyese. (The VIP area at all the shows we performed at were full. After the show, Roya Mapaike disappeared with all the money). Taenda kumba kwake arikunzi akabva Friday chaiyo.

(Trevor Dongo left his family only to return to them without a cent.) “Marimakaita zvisati zvamboonekwa (You made a lot of money,) so wat was the reason of running away,” she said. Mai TT also pointed out that Jah Signal and Enzo Ishall were also duped by the same promoter. “Jah signal ataura nhasi kuti makamudaro akazodzoka nemariyake azvibhadharira ndege.
