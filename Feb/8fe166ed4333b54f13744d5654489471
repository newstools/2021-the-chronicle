The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter LISTED retail chain, OK Zimbabwe says the anticipated bumper harvest will spur consumer spending and consumption despite the Covid-19 pandemic, which has squeezed its performance as customer movements have been limited. The 2020/21 summer cropping season is promising to yield positive results on account of good rains and farmers are excited. In a trading update for the third quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2020, the retail chain said while the curtailment of non-essential business activity and restrictions on people mobility impacts both the supply chain and customer activity in retail outlets, its business has experienced reasonable levels of trade. “Our stores were reasonably stocked at the end of the festive season and manufacturers of essential products have resumed production and are delivering goods to our stores,” said the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange-listed firm. “The good rainfall received this agricultural season points to a good harvest and this is expected to result in improved consumer spending power and consumption.” The retail chain comprises OK Stores, Money Wave, Bon Marchè, and OK Mart. “Sales volumes grew by seven percent for the quarter but were below prior year by 15 percent for the nine months,” said the retail chain. -@okazunga
