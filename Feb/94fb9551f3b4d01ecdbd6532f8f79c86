Chronicle is coordinating an initiative to help the family of the 108-year-old Bulilima man whose homestead was recently set on fire by his granddaughter’s boyfriend. Family spokesperson Miss Sibongile Nzimande said the family lost everything as the alleged arsonist, Felix Moyo, was threatening to kill anyone who dared to enter the burning huts to remove property. She said Moyo disappeared after the arson and by then everything had been reduced to ashes. The 108-year-old grandfather, Mr Lewis Phiri, lives with his wife, Mrs Esinathisina Phiri (66), as well as his grandchildren and great children Sibongile Zimande (22), Nobesuthu Nyathi (25), Siphephisiwe Nyathi (8), Trevor Zimande (9), Cidreck Phiri (5), Nokuthaba Nyathi (5) and all the family members lost everything in the fire. Mr Phiri said he has been reduced to a destitute and appealed to well-wishers to help his family. Donations have started trickling in after people who were touched by the family`s plight extended a helping hand. With what has been received so far, a two-roomed house is under construction at the family homestead in Tjinjika Village using funds from well-wishers. Community members are providing free labour. Family spokesperson Sibongile Zimande said the family needs a number of items. <img class="alignnone wp-image-530401 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/new1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/new1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/new1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “All our clothes, blankets were destroyed we appeal to well-wishers to assist us with those and food items like mealie-meal. Our grandfather is also having a difficult time sleeping on the floor as his bed was burnt, if we can get just a single bed for him to sleep on he will be able to sleep well,” she said. Those who want to help the family can contact Miss Zimande on 0776 572 691 which is also her EcoCash account number. Mr Derreck Ncube who is coordinating donations in South Africa urged more people and companies to help the family. “Our wish is to change this family’s tragic story for good. We really wish we could build them something beautiful that will make them forget about what they lost in terms of their huts. Through the donations we are getting both in Zimbabwe, South Africa and other countries we have started something. We wish more people and companies can join our efforts to change the centenarian’s life,” he said. Chronicle is urging members of the public, religious bodies and the corporate world to join hands to change the life of the 108-year-old man and his family at a time when they are homeless. Donations can also be dropped at Chronicle offices. Chronicle deputy news editor Temba Dube said the story which was carried by Chronicle touched many people, hence the call to action to put smiles on their faces. —@themkhust
