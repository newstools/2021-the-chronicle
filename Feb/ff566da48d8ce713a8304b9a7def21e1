ZIMBABWE expects better cotton yields this year compared to last year on the back of good rains although production in some areas is likely to be adversely affected by excessive rains. More farmers also took up cotton production this year particularly in new areas as Cottco embarked on a drive to increase the coverage of the Presidential Cotton Inputs Scheme. Under the scheme, the Government procures the inputs, which are then distributed through The Cotton Company of Zimbabwe. The inputs package includes fertilisers, seed and chemicals. The Government came up with the scheme to help revive production, which declined to 28 000 tonnes in 2015 on the back of subdued support to farmers in terms of funding. Farmers had also abandoned cotton production citing poor prices. The Presidential Cotton Inputs Scheme saw production expanding since 2015, reaching 144 000 tonnes in 2018, but back-to-back droughts saw production declining in 2019 and 2020. Speaking during field tours in Mutawatawa and Murehwa this week, Cottco managing director Mr Pious Manamike, said prospects for better yields were bright this season. “We have received good rains and this should help us to achieve better yields although in some areas production will be affected by excessive rains,” said Mr Manamike. The purpose of the field visit was to have an appreciation of the crop situation and interact with farmers to understand their concerns.
