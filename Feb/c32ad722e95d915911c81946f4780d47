Known for his yesteryear 2005 hit song titled Plumtree, Nkomo has been in the arts industry for decades. He is currently based in South Africa where he is a drama educator at Randfontein High School. Commenting on the poem, Nkomo said: “Last year, Handsome Sibanda, an arts promoter in Plumtree asked me to do a 20th century poem about Plumtree town. I was requested and also challenged by ama2000 and therefore I took the challenge. “The poem talks about Plumtree yesterday and today mainly the new faces and changes in Plumtree. I also mourn Plumtree sons and daughters who have passed away the likes of DJ Breeze and Thubelihle among others.” Having trained arts gurus that include Nkululeko Nkala, Nkomo is the founder and director of Thabo Arts Academy which was formed in 2005 at Madabe School in Plumtree.
