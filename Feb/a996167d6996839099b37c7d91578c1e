SEVEN armed robbers raided a family from Bulawayo’s Bellevue suburb and got away with a car, cash and other valuables. The incident occurred last Friday at around 1AM. The robbers who were armed with knives and machetes are said to have used a bolt-cutter to gain entry into the house. They got away with an X-Trail vehicle, cash, cellphones, laptops and decoders among other gadgets. The victim Ms Charity Nyathi revealed her ordeal through a Facebook post on Friday. “Daring armed robbers broke into our home and took my car, money, cellphones, laptops and other valuables. Thanks to God they spared our lives. Please look out for a Black X- Trail AFB 8110,” said Ms Nyathi. She later wrote that the car had been recovered but did not state where. Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said investigations on the matter are still in progress. <img class="wp-image-523287 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/abeddd.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/abeddd.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/abeddd-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Inspector Abednico Ncube “We are investigating an armed robbery case where seven suspects armed with knives and machetes broke into a house in Bellevue on Friday at about 1AM. The armed robbers used a bolt cutter to force their way into the house. They then proceeded to the owner’s bedroom which was closed but not locked where they demanded cash and got US$30 and Z$150. They took away a laptop and Samsung cellphone, before moving to another room where they got away with another Samsung cellphone and laptop. They moved to another room where they grabbed two cellphones, Hisense and Huawei. They also got away with an open view decoder. No one was hurt in the process,” said Insp Ncube. He said after ransacking the rooms, the robbers returned to the main bedroom where they demanded more money but when they realised that their victim did not have more money they took away her car. “We are appealing to members of the public who might have information that may lead to the arrest of the suspects to contact any nearest police station,” he said. Insp Ncube said he did not have information on the recovery of the car. Recently, police said six Bulawayo western suburbs have become hotspot for burglars and in some cases women were raped. — nqotshili
