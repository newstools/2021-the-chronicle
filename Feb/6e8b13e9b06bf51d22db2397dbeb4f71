The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter A SOMBRE atmosphere engulfed Mpofu village in Lupane on Saturday when a village head, who died from burns sustained when his grandson doused a three roomed house with petrol before setting it alight, was buried. Robert Donga (75) died at Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo on Wednesday night following the Tuesday fire which had left him with severe burns all over the body. His wife Angela Mpala (52) missed the burial as she is still admitted to St Lukeâ€™s Hospital in Lupane while a domestic worker Praymore Sibanda (19) is in a critical condition at Mpilo Central Hospital. Seven people were sleeping in the house on Tuesday when Kholwani Donga (26) allegedly doused it with petrol before setting it alight forcing the occupants to escape through the window. Ms Ayanda Donga (23), three nieces Bandile Donga (8), Buhle Hadebe (10) and Andile Hadebe (7) escaped with no injuries. Nothing was salvaged from the house as the family lost all its belongings.
