GRADE 7 pupils will, starting this year, sit for six subjects instead of five under the competence-based curriculum which the learners embarked on in 2017 when they were in Grade 3. The new Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (Zimsec) structure shows pupils will write Mathematics; English Language; Indigenous Language; Agriculture, Science and Technology and ICT; Social Sciences and Physical Education and Arts. The last Grade 7 examination class wrote Mathematics, Agriculture, English, Indigenous Language and General Paper. Zimsec public relations manager Mrs Nicky Dhlamini said:
“Yes the structure is a true reflection of Zimsec exams. This is in line with the new curriculum. This class started the new curriculum in Grade 3 as scheduled, and in accordance with the framework Zimsec has put in place the structure.” Mrs Dhlamini said the schools structure and compliance is under the supervision of the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education.
