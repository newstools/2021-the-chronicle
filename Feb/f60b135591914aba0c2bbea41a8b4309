The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Spoken word poet, Energy Mavaza is set to release his second poetry anthology titled Beneath the African Sun online this Friday. The Bulawayo-bred artists’ book is a poetry collection that sums up most African socio-economic day to day issues in poetic artistry. The book which is a follow up to his debut, Loud Thoughts is set to be available on Amazon and ibooks. Inspired by the late former British soldier and poet Wilfred Owen who penned most of his World War 1 experiences through poetry, the 32-year-old artiste who uses the stage name Poyetik Energy said the book will also be available at National Art Galleries in Bulawayo, Gweru and Harare. “Beneath the African Sun, is my 2021 project that zooms closer home to issues affecting the people of colour. Those issues may be overwhelming for an anthology of 50 poems, but Beneath the African Sun dwells more on Africanism, black pride, culture and other darker vices of our blackness through emotional artistry of poetry. My first anthology that was published last year was a collection of 10 poets who were drawn from various social media platforms. The book contains poems that communicate contemporary social issues from youths’ perspective,” said Poyetik Energy. – @mthabisi_mthire
