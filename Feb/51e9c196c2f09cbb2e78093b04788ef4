The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Gwanda Correspondent Recently licensed Ntepe-Manama Community Radio (NMCR) has called on the Gwanda community to embrace the radio station as it is committed to covering the digital divide gap and providing locals with critical information on current affairs as well as provide entertainment. The Gwanda station which recently paid its license fees was setup to ensure there is access to information by areas that have been without local broadcasting frequency since independence. The station is now waiting for its transmitters to be installed so that it can be fully operational. They are also hoping to identify the studio’s location during a board meeting set to be held soon. In an interview yesterday as the station commemorated World Radio Day, NMCR programmes officer, Siphathisiwe Ncube said: “NMCR celebrates World Radio Day with all smiles as this year’s commemorations came at a time when NMCR had been granted a radio license by the BAZ authority. This achievement within our community marks the beginning of a huge development in our community. “We have hope that as soon as the station gets transmitters, it will play a very significant role of a true community radio in developing the community and giving information on current affairs and other developmental issues within the community.” She said former marginalised languages, among them Sotho and Venda, will get favourable airplay as part of efforts of embracing and promoting the community voices. Once operational, the radio station will cover a radius of over 40 kilometres, with communities in Gwanda South, North and central as well as Kezi and Beitbridge also expected to access the station. – @mthabisi_mthire
