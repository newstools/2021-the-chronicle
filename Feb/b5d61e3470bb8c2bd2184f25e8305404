The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Ugandan born artiste, Anthony Kabugo Nyanzi who is also a businessman, is a man with the zeal of redefining the status quo of the continent’s arts sector. Through his company, International Music Africa Academy which he founded in 2016 to train artistes in various arts fields, the 27-year-old last year introduced a talent show named Talented Africa which he is planning on holding this year. With two million Rand up for grabs, the competition is expected to attract thousands of hopefuls from across 54 countries in the continent. Nyanzi, a multi-talented artiste, plays more than three music instruments. He is also a choreographer, singer and motivational speaker. Speaking from his Kwazulu Natal base in South Africa, he said: “I’ve always been passionate about arts and this is why I formed the International Music African Academy (Imma) which is the mother body of Talented Africa. “Imma is also an organisation that offers guitar, modern dance, ballet, piano, drum, filming, music production, stage management, sound technology and events management lessons,” said the artiste who plays the piano, drums, acoustic and bass guitars. Nyanzi said he was inspired to create the talent show because of the scarcity of events supporting African arts under one roof. He said part of the funds to host the Talented Africa talent search show have been sourced and they are calling on willing sponsors to jump on board. – @mthabisi_mthire
