Afro-Jazz musician, Jeys Marabini says he will be dropping a new single in the coming days that will surprise many people as he has deviated from his traditional beat. Born Majahawodwa Ndlovu, Marabini was speaking to the publication while attending the funeral of the late Filabusi chief Maduna. “I have a new single that I’ve done. I’m busy working on the video to accompany the song. I’m going to surprise lots of people. Ngibuya ngenye indlela emnandi kakhulu. People should just watch out for this one. It will be out very soon. I want to test the market. I believe it is a very good song and the genre that I have chosen it is a very good one,” he said. Jeys said he diverted from his traditional beat as a way of expanding his market. This should not be a shock as the Emarabini hit marker started off as an Imbube artist before venturing into Afro-Jazz. After the single he said will also be dishing out a new album before the year ends. “My fans have been crying for another album, so definitely this year I will be giving them what they want. Our task is to give the people what they want so since they want an album, I will give them one,” he said. The NAMA award winner said he will be collaborating with a number of artistes including from Harare in the fourth coming album. He last released an album Ntunjambila in 2018 and this upcoming one will be his 10th.- @themkhust
