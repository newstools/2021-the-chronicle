The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent SOUTH Africa-based DJ Zwesta has bounced back with a sizzling track about dedication, love and endurance that is due to be released this Friday. Titled Uzobuya, the track is a fusion of Amapiano and Afro pop. It features Tomie, an up-and-coming vocalist who is based in Kwazulu Natal, South Africa. DJ Zwesta (real name Zwelihle Mathe) is the name behind hit tracks –We Rise featuring Yasirah Bhelz, Rafiki featuring Nkwali and Lashona Ilanga featuring Miss Twaggy, all which have had heavy rotation on radio stations in South Africa and Zimbabwe. The Nkayi-born house music producer said the song is about the enduring love between two people. The East London-based artiste said he produced the song last year, but it took four months before he got the perfect vocalist. “The song came about in a very mysterious way. I produced the instrumental last year and it sounded like a big song. Four months passed as I was trying to find the perfect vocalist for it as it had a different sound from what is trending nowadays. “It’s only in January this year that I received a text from an up-and-coming vocalist in KZN who had seen my trending videos on TV channels in SA and loved my sound. He expressed his keenness to work with me and after listening to three demo clips, he was impressed and we started working together,” said DJ Zwesta.
