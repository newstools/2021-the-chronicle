A 22-year-old Bulilima man is battling for life after he was struck with an axe by a member of a rival soccer team following a dispute over final score, police have confirmed. Msingisi Ncube (28) of Cingo Village under Headman Ndolwane in Bulilima district, Matabeleland South allegedly struck Fidelis Dube once on the head with an axe. Dube sustained a deep cut and is battling for life at the Plumtree District Hospital. Matabeleland South provincial police spokesperson Inspector Loveness Mangena said the incident occurred last Saturday at around 7PM. “I can confirm that Dube was struck on the head with an axe and was rushed to Plumtree District Hospital. Dube and Ncube were playing football at Cingo Village on January 30 and the match ended as a 2-2 all draw. Dube claimed they had won the match and this triggered Ncube to pick up an axe and hit Dube with the axe handle on the chest. “The fight was controlled and when Ncube left, Dube followed him armed with a claw hammer,” said Insp Mangena. Insp Mangena said Ncube overpowered Dube and struck him with an axe on the head. Ncube was arrested and is assisting police with investigations. “Ncube managed to disarm Dube and he struck him with the axe on the head and he sustained a deep cut on the head before he was rushed to the hospital,” she said. Inspector Mangena warned members of the public against breaking the law by defying lockdown regulations. “In the first place, the soccer match defied the ban of public gatherings and sporting activities. “We urge members of the public to desist from defying the call to stay at home and observe lockdown regulations put in place by Government. As police we will not hesitate to arrest the offenders,” said Insp Mangena.−@mthabisi_mthire
