The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter DESPITE being linked with a move away from Villa Park, Zimbabwe international midfielder Marvelous Nakamba is set to stay at Aston Villa at least up to the end of this season. The English Premiership transfer window closed last night and Nakamba was being linked with a deadline day move to fellow Premiership sides Newcastle United and Crystal Palace, but nothing materialised. Nakamba has also previously been linked with a move to Turkish side Galatasaray and Spanish top tier outfit Valencia. Now that he is staying at Aston Villa, the Warriors’ midfielder will have to do more to force his way back into the Birmingham-based side. He has to continue fighting for a first team slot with Brazilian midfielder Douglas Luiz and John Mc Ginn as well as new signing Morgan Sanson, who was acquired from Marseille for £14million.
