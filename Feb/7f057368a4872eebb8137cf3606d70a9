The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent JAZZ musician Agenda Maphosa seems to appreciate the power of collaborations after the success of Masiyephambili as he has roped in eight artistes for his forthcoming single which he completed recording this week. The power of collaborations was recently showcased when 18 artistes from Bulawayo teamed up for a track titled Masiyephambili. A few months after the song’s release, it is now receiving regional recognition with the artistes who featured on the project undeniably being put on the map. <img class="wp-image-531277 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/fabg.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/fabg.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/fabg-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Fab G From this success story, Maphosa was motivated to work with others hence his decision to rope in eight diverse artistes for his Presser/Pusher/Phanda single.

I wanted it to have different styles in order to make it unique,” he said. On the selection of artistes, Maphosa said he opted for up-and-coming artistes as he wanted fresh talent. “As a person who has a lot of friends in the music industry, the selection of artistes was challenging but I decided to approach those whom I knew had the ability and would be compatible with the verses I had,” said Maphosa. He urged other artistes to consider collaborations saying they bring diversity. — @mthabisi_mthire
