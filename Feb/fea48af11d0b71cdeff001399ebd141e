The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter SPORTS and Recreation Commission (SRC) acting director-general Sabastian Garikai has reiterated that national sport associations need to re-apply for waivers if they wish to resume sporting activities this year. Garakai indicated that even if an association had applied for resumption last year, they have to re-apply after circumstances changed when the country imposed a stricter lockdown at the beginning of the year. “The resumption of any sporting activity in the country is guided by the prevailing Covid-19 regulations in the country to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. Before the introduction of Statutory Instrument 10 of 2021, which invoked the Level 4 national lockdown, sport associations had applied for resumption of their activities and there were applications that had been approved, but that was before Statutory Instrument 10 of 2021. Therefore, we then asked associations to re-apply for the continuation or resumption of activities after the new instrument. “The commission issued a statement calling upon all sporting associations wishing to have activities during the lockdown period to re-apply. “Some sport associations have applied and their applications are being considered, while some have been approved already. We are moving step by step in a safe manner. We are saying all sporting associations that wish to resume activities should apply to the Sports and Recreation Commission,” Garikai told Classic 263 radio.
