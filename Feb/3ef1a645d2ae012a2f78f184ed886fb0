The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent THE year 2021 seems to be one that underdogs from Gwanda have decided to use to make themselves known as they are yearning for recognition and aren’t stopping at anything. Such is the case with Thaluso Moyo who uses the stage name Thaluso Da Poet. He is a force to reckon with if his successes are anything to go by. Hailing from rural Gwanda, southwest in Mawane village, the former Ntepe Secondary School student is a poet who was named the 2020 Intwasa Arts Festival poetry slam winner. In 2019, the talented poet was part of the Lafarge poetry slam and recently, he was nominated for the Empire 263 Awards under the Best Newcomer across all genres category. Now based in Bulawayo, Thaluso Da Poet said he ventured into poetry due to his love for the Ndebele-Zulu culture and passion for edutainment. “During my tenure as a student at Bulawayo Polytechnic in 2018, I decided to pursue my arts passion. Now, I have six poems available on my YouTube page. “The poems are Umthandazo weCovid-19, Africa Shiya okwabanye, Lob’ ungasangqomanga, Africa intombi nto, Kudlaliwe ngabantu la and Father Zimbabwe featuring Moyoxide,” Thaluso Da Poet said. He said he is now working on another poem titled Sondela S’thandwa which he will release on Saturday. “Sondela S’thandwa is a Valentine’s Day special love poem centred on love relationships,” he said. – @mthabisi_mthire
