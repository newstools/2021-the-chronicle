THE Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) says it is fully behind Government’s fight against Covid-19 and has called upon its membership and the entire business community to contribute towards mobilising US$100 million needed to procure vaccines. Recently, the Government announced that it has set aside US$100 million for the procurement of Covid-19 vaccine while the Chinese government extended 200 000 doses of its Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine to the country. Zimbabwe is expected to receive its first batch of the Covid-19 vaccine this week with the second one expected at the beginning of next month. CZR president Mr Denford Mutashu said as an organisation they have declared a war against the pandemic. “CZR is calling upon all retailers, wholesalers and the entire business community to rally behind Government in the fight against the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. “Government recently invited the business community and private sector to extend a hand in the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines, which requires close to US$100 million. “This is an opportunity for businesses to come to the party and play a critical role in saving the masses who also double up as their consumers,” he said. Mr Mutashu said it was important to note that this was a life and death situation where close collaboration regardless of political inclination remains critical in defeating the pandemic. “Business should emulate yesteryear business people who supported the liberation struggle. One person saved through vaccines procurement is one potential customer retained,” said the CZR boss. Mr Mutashu said there is no amount of financial assistance considered small, adding that the donations and contributions for this initiative can be sent directly to the National Disaster Fund account. — @okazunga
