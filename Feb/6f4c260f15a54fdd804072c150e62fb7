The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter Norman Mapeza, the FC Platinum coach, says his troops are fully aware of what they will be up against when they encounter Senegalese side ASC Jaaraf in the Caf Confederation Cup first-leg play-offs at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday. The gaffer said what’s clear in their minds is the need to fully use home advantage by scoring as many goals as possible to avoid the agony of reliving their Tanzanian experience where they were whacked 4-0 by Simba SC after winning the first-leg 1-0 in the Caf Champions League. Mapeza says that thrashing was now water under the bridge, but “we learnt painful lessons”. “We know the challenges we are going to face on Sunday, but the message has been the same; we need to maximise on home advantage. We need goals, this tournament is all about goals and we really need to score as many goals as we can. You never know what might happen when we go to Senegal. We learnt a cruel lesson against Simba SC. We saw what happened, but it’s now water under the bridge. Sunday, like I said, is all about goals,” Mapeza told Chronicle Sport. The return leg is set for February 21 in Dakar, with the winner proceeding to the mini-league stage whose matches will come thick and fast from March 10 to April 28. Pure Platinum Play have enough tried and trusted players in their ranks that have the pedigree to propel the team, not just past the play-offs, but to the mini-league. In goalkeeper and captain Petros Mhari, imposing defender Lawrence Mhlanga, Gift Bello, Raphael Muduviwa, Rahman Kutsanzira, Brian Banda, Rodwell Chinyengetere, Ralph Kawondera and Nomore Chinyerere, Pure Platinum Play remain a formidable outfit.
