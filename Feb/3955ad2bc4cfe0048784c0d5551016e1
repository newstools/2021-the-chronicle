Government ministries and departments should quickly migrate the data and information currently stored in their mini centres to the National Data Centre, President Mnangagwa has said. He said for greater success, it was important for Government ministries to establish a strategic e platform to facilitate the availability of timely sharing of critical information. President Mnangagwa said this today while launching the National Data Centre, which is aimed at creating a one-stop centre for all Government data. “This will ultimately bring about fiscal relief through cost savings brought about by the sharing of data storage and processing facilities,” said President Mnangagwa.
