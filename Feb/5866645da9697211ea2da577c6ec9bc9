The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter WARRIORS midfielder Maverllous Nakamba is being linked with a deadline day move to either Newcastle United or Crystal Palace. The English Premier League transfer window closes at midnight on Monday and Nakamba could be on his way out of Villa Park, according to reports on the Birmingham Live website. The website says Palace and Newcastle are said to have shown a late interest in the Zimbabwean international. The midfielder has fallen out of favour at Villa this season and has been subject to transfer speculation as calls for him to seek game time elsewhere grow louder. He made 19 Premier League appearances for Villa last term and only two in the current season Nakamba has also previously been linked with a move to Turkish side Galatasaray and Spanish top tier outfit Valencia. â€“ @innocentskizoe
