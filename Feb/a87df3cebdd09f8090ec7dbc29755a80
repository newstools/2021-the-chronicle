The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter WITH Caf Champions League action on the horizon for on loan Peter Muduhwa, the central defender is not pressing any panic buttons. Muduhwa, who joined the football crusade to East Africa by joining Simba SC on a six-month loan deal late last month, is part of the 27-member squad visiting the DR Congo for a date against AS Vita this weekend. The Tanzanians, who progressed to the mini-league phase after crushing Zimbabwean champions FC Platinum 4-0 in the second-leg for a 4-1 aggregate win, are in Group A alongside defending champions Al Ahly of Egypt, Sudanese giants El-Merreikh and AS Vita. In an interview from Dar es Salaam, Muduhwa insisted that he was not new to the demands of international assignments. “Everything is fine. I’m not any under pressure because I have represented Zimbabwe on numerous occasions. As such, this is not a different international assignment for me. I will just do my best,” said Muduhwa, who was specifically roped in by the Tanzanian side to bolster their arsenal for the Caf Champions League campaign. He will not feature in Simba SC’s fight to retain the Vodacom Tanzania Mainland Premier League since the East African country’s transfer window closed on January 15. Last Saturday, he watched from the terraces when Simba SC took on arch rivals Azam FC, which is home to Muduhwa’s former Bosso teammates Prince Dube and Bruce Kangwa. The match ended in a two-all stalemate. Simba have indicated that should Muduhwa impress in the African safari, they will open negotiations with Highlanders for a permanent deal. Muduhwa recently extended his contract with Highlanders by another year. – @FungaiMuderere
