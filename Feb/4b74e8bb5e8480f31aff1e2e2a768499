The Chronicle SUPERSPORT United striker Evans Rusike says his side will be looking to do a league double over Kaizer Chiefs when the two sides meet tomorrow. The two sides met earlier during this campaign where SuperSport triumphed 2-1 at the Lucas Masterpieces Moripe Stadium. Goals from Bradley Grobler and Sipho Mbule ensured victory for Matsatsantsa. Rusike was a notable absentee for SuperSport on the night as the Zimbabwean was making his way back from a long-term knee injury, which required surgery. Now, having featured for SuperSport in their last three games, the Zimbabwean has taken aim at a wounded Amakhosi, who are fresh from a 2-1 midweek loss to AmaZulu. “We are just focused on the next game, which is Chiefs because we just take it one game at a time,” Rusike told the Siya crew. “It’s a big game, you know. We obviously want to do well in those kinds of games. They are also trying to find their feet, so it’s going to be a hard game, but we want to collect maximum points this weekend,” he said. Asked if his side can do the double over Chiefs this season, the 30-year-old revealed that his side are wary of a possible backlash from Gavin Hunt’s men this weekend. “When you collect points against any team, just know that when they are playing you again they don’t want a repetition, so they come even more prepared than the last time,” he explained. — Soccer Laduma
