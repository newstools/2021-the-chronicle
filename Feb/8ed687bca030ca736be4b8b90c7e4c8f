Contemporary musician Hwabaraty who believes that his music is spiritual and brings people together says the Zimbabwe Music Awards (Zima) nomination in the Best Alternative category has motivated him to do more. Hwabaraty (real name Japhet Mlauzi) is nominated alongside Tahle WeDzinza, Andy Muridzo and Nkwali. Last year, he won the Outstanding Alternative (Maskandi/Jazz) Music Artist award at the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards. Now, he is eyeing the Zima as national recognition will be a big step in cementing his name. Hwabaraty said: “I’m humbled to be nominated for this year’s PPC Zimbabwe Music Awards in the Best Alternative category. Here’s to more creating and peace building as music for me is spiritual and has the capacity to bring people together.” The artiste who trended last year following his appearance at a virtual gala where some quizzed who he was after he was introduced to the stage, paid homage to those who have been supporting his music career saying they were the ones behind the recognition he is receiving. “The appreciation from fans has made me grow as an artiste. It’s great to know that my music is having an impact on many people as they’re always texting encouraging me. This (Zima nomination) is for them,” said Hwabaraty. Win or not, Hwabaraty said the nomination alone is a great boost for his career. “Winning will be the cherry on the cake. The nomination alone shows that I’m recognised nationally and this is a great thing for myself and the career that I hold dearly,” he said.
