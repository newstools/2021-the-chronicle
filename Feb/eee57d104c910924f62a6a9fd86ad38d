The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FC Platinum arrived in Dakar, Senegal, on Wednesday night ahead of their weekend’s clash with ASC Jaraaf in the Caf Confederation Cup second l-leg playoff. Announcing their arrival in Dakar before midnight, FC Platinum said: “The team has landed safely in Dakar ahead of the second-leg of the Caf Confederation Cup match against ASC Jaraaf. Having crushed 1-0 at home the team remains optimistic of a positive result in the reverse fixture. Coach (Norman) Mapeza has urged the boys to hold their heads high into the match as he has faith in them #pureplatinumplay.” ASC Jaraaf’s home defeat in their last Caf Confederation Cup has given FC Platinum reason to believe that they can overturn the 1-0 deficit in Dakar. Last Sunday, FC Platinum failed to use home advantage by fluffing numerous scoring opportunities, including a 26th minute penalty missed by Silas Songani. ASC Jaraaf punished the platinum miners through Albert Diene goal in the 69th minute. – @ZililoR
