UP and coming musician Buhlebenkosi “Roxcy Biey’ Dube wants to remind couples to shun Gender Based Violence (GBV) during this Valentine’s Day through a song Sekwanele. The Lupane State University student, studying film, TV and media studies, wants to use her first song to bring awareness to the global problem of GBV. Sekwanele is an Afro pop song, was released last week and is being played on Khulumani FM and Skyz Metro FM. She said everyone knows about GBV but not all are brave enough to talk about it. “Being human is relational, it means whether I am a victim or not, I have to be able to help someone open up about their experiences. With my song I used what I have heard about GBV and I made sure that my audience is able to relate just the way I did. I want that person who was once abused to be able to feel my emotions in the song and be able to stand up for themselves,” said Roxcy Biey. The 22-year-old said award winning Msizkay encouraged her to pursue a career in music. “I started doing music at a professional level in 2016 and I’ve since worked with people like Msizkay who happened to have taken me in and really helped me out a lot in my journey in music. I’ve worked with quite a number of artists and I’m really looking forward to working more in the future,” said Roxcy Biey. She worked with Msizkay in the song Uyang’thanda, Angithandabuzi, Ngixolele featuring Zhezhingtons and Ezulwini featuring Bweezy Bwoi.
