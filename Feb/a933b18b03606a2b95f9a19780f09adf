RHUMBA ace, Allen Ndoda who silently went to the United Kingdom last year raising alarm among his fans that he had quit music, has said nothing will separate him from music. Quizzed about his move to the UK, the Ngizoqal’eTsholotsho hit-maker who fronts the Challengers band, said: “I’m just visiting and seeing other parts of the world.” But whatever it is that he is doing overseas is definitely taking up his time as it took weeks for Chronicle Showbiz to get an interview with him. Ndoda said even though he is in the UK, nothing can separate him from the guitar as he is busy rehearsing with Rhumba Professor, Madalaboy online for their fourth collaboration. “We are very busy with Madalaboy doing online practice. An album, Jupita 4 will be out soon. We are using the internet to practice and exchange recordings,” he said. Allen however, said it is challenging doing rehearsals online as feelings are not well communicated via the internet.
He assured fans that he will never abandon them. “I’ll never retire from music no matter the situation. I may visit all countries in the world but the guitar is what I want next to my coffin,” said Ndoda. <img class="wp-image-533388 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Allen-Ndoda.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Allen-Ndoda.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Allen-Ndoda-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> I cannot separate myself from the guitar His manager, Peter Nkomo said the musician went to the UK to “study music”. “He’s studying music to see what he can add and improve on. He also wants to develop himself as an artiste. He has not hung up his guitar as some say but he is busy preparing for the next album with Madalaboy. Nkomo said Covid-19 restrictions had delayed Ndoda’s return from UK. He said fans should therefore prepare for Ndoda’s welcome back show once the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions are relaxed. “I cannot give you details of what else he is doing in UK outside of music but what I can tell you is that he’s busy preparing for new albums with Madalaboy and his band. What he’s doing in the UK will be felt in his music. “Allen loves music so much and he goes out of his way to come up with the best,” he said. Over the years, Allen Ndoda, also known as the Ghost, has contributed a lot in the growth of the Rhumba genre and is regarded as the King of collaborations. Hailing from Makhulela in Bulilima District, he has churned out 29 albums, 21 with his band with the other being collaborations with various artists. The musician has also done collaborations with Mxolisi “Mr Bones” Ndlovu, Gift Amuli, Tornado Heroes and Disco singer Fortue Dawu among others. — @themkhust
