According to one border official who declined to be named, they are handling an average of 700 travellers daily at Beitbridge. “This is down from the 5 000 we were handling during the festive season and before the new national lockdown regulations kicked in,” said the official. It is reported that a total of 1 200 commercial trucks are passing through Sadc and the country’s busiest inland port of entry daily. The Zimbabwe National Roads Administration (Zinara) spokesperson, Mr Tendai Mugabe said they had noted a relative decline in light vehicles using the border in the last two weeks. “We processed a total of 9 100 light vehicles at Beitbridge between January 1 and January 14. Now we are seeing a decline, which we believe is linked to the strict enforcement of national lockdown laws. Between January 15 and January 27, we processed only 2 100 light motor vehicles,” said Mr Mugabe. Before the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, Beitbridge Border Post, used to handle 15 000 travellers, 2 500 light motor vehicles, 120 buses and 600 commercial trucks daily.
