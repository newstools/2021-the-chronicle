BUBI-Lupane Dam is one of the flagship Government projects that symbolises hope and economic growth for local communities. Last week, scores of locals rushed to experience the magnificent spilling of the dam, which last happened in 2016. The dam was commissioned in June 2012 by the late Mr Morgan Tsvangirai who was then Prime Minister during the inclusive Government. Already, Government is developing a 180-hectare irrigation scheme, which will draw water from the 40 million cubic-metre dam. At least 90 families are set to benefit once the irrigation scheme situated in Mpofu Village under Chief Mabhikwa is operational. The irrigation scheme will harness abundant water from the dam. Bubi-Lupane Dam supplies water to both Kusile Rural District Council and Lupane Local Board and surrounding areas including Lupane State University (LSU). Lupane is a rural semi-arid area with a growing population and some infrastructural expansion after it was accorded the capital status of the province. The area falls under Savanah climate largely characterised by woodlands and grasslands. The Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service (ZPCS) is also utilising the water body through a thriving aquaculture project. When it was launched in December 2018, ZPCS put 10 000 tilapia fingerlings in a cage in the dam. The fish were harvested the following year. Lupane Women’s Centre (LWC) director Ms Hildigard Mufukare said they are also using water from the dam to irrigate a horticulture project. “We are involved in a horticulture and maize project and we are using water from Bubi-Lupane Dam to irrigate the crops. This year we are focusing on animal food and we planted 2 hectares of Brazilian grass for our goats to increase animal production,” she said. Mrs Siphathisiwe Makuwi, a committee member of the Mpofu Irrigation Scheme, said the project will help them generate money to feed their families as well as take their children to school. <img class="wp-image-529169 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/lupp1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/lupp1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/lupp1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ms Siphathisiwe Makhuwe Mpofu “We are excited about this irrigation scheme that is being developed by Government. It will assist us in many ways particularly when it comes to raising money for school fees. Currently, we are relying on rains and Government has assisted with us with inputs,” she said. “We have three tractors and two centre pivots at the moment. Fencing of the irrigation scheme has started while pipes are now on the ground awaiting connection to the dam.” Mpofu Village head Ms Mathini Mlotshwa said the envisaged irrigation scheme is set to transform lives when fully operational. <img class="wp-image-529172 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/lupp.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/lupp.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/lupp-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Headman Mathani Mlotshwa Mpofu “The community is excited about this new development in their area. This dam has abundant water and for years it has been underutilised, but with this new project shaping up, we are going to harness water and boost security in our country,” she said. Another local villager, Mr George Moyo, who relies on fishing to feed his family, said the dam is his only source of livelihood. <img class="wp-image-529168 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/fishing.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/fishing.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/fishing-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lupane villagers fishing at Bubi Lupane Dam yesterday He said on a good day he catches up to 10 fish and each is sold for US$1 to US$4, depending on size. “I come here every day to fish and this is how I eke out a living. I am a father of five and we depend on the business of selling fish from this dam. Three of my children are of the school going age and through this fish business I am able to pay their school fees. My fish range from US$1 to US$4 depending on the size,” he said. Zinwa corporate communications and marketing manager Mrs Marjorie Munyonga said before the construction of the dam and the water treatment plant, Lupane relied on boreholes, which were failing to meet the demand for water. She said they have since also improved the storage capacity in Lupane following the construction of two reservoirs dedicated to LSU. “Following the construction of the Bubi-Lupane Dam and water treatment plant, Lupane is now being supplied using the treatment plant which has a capacity to treat 240 cubic meters of water per hour,” said Mrs Munyonga. She said Zinwa has also installed bulk community taps that are supplying treated water to the Mpofu community. Mrs Munyonga said the Bubi-Lupane Dam has also made it possible for Zinwa to connect more people to the water reticulation system, including access to water. “In terms of irrigation, the relevant arms of Government are already working on the establishment of a 180-hectare irrigation scheme to benefit from the dam. Establishment of the scheme is at an advanced with some of the equipment such as centre pivots already in place while the pump house and abstraction pipelines from the dam are still outstanding,” said Mrs Munyonga. “The Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services also have two fish cages in the dam where they are breeding fish.” — @mashnets
