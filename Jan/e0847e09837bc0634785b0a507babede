SOUTH Africa based DJ Zandimaz, of the Emathandweni fame, has teamed up with breakout producer DJ Obza behind the smash Amapiano hit, Mang’dakiwe, in a song, Umgqibelo, a tribute to the late rapper Cal Vin. Building on the success of her hit track Emathandweni featuring SA’s Nokwazi on the vocals, Esigodini born DJ Zandimaz (real name Zandile Mazithulela) said Umgqibelo will be released next month. Emathandweni has garnered over two million views on YouTube and was one of the festive season tracks, including Mang’dakiwe by DJ Obza. She said originally Umgqibelo was supposed to be a Gqom track that was worked on by Cal Vin, but she has decided to remake it as an Amapiano track. “The song that I’m working on with DJ Obza is Umgqibelo which is a tribute to my late friend Cal Vin. “He and I were going to work on Umgqibelo as a Gqom song, but I’ve decided to make the song a Amapiano track. The song will be also released as a Gqom track later on in the year,” said DJ Zandimaz. <img class="wp-image-527924 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/zandimaz.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/zandimaz.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/zandimaz-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DJ Zandimaz “Besides myself and DJ Obza, the song will have surprise artistes and I promise people that it will be a dope track. I’m building on the momentum from Emathandweni.” DJ Zandimaz said she met DJ Obza when he produced her breakout hit, Emathandweni last year. “The secret that people don’t even know is that, DJ Obza was part of the production team of Emathandweni. Working with Obza is one of the best experiences as he is young and fresh and our energies connected. “He is free and very humble and he is there to allow me to grow and I’m there to embrace him and his talent,” said DJ Zandimaz. She said an EP with DJ Obza was in the pipeline. <img class="wp-image-527926 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Obza1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Obza1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Obza1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DJ Obza “We are working on a lot of tracks and we want to release an EP together during the year. It’s a journey that we embarked on and we have a long way to go. “I hope they will receive this song with the same energy they did with Emathandweni,” she said.
