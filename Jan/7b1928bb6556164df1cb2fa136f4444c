The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter PETER Muduhwa has completed his move to Simba SC of Tanzania after putting pen to paper on a six-month loan deal on Tuesday. The Zimbabwe defender arrived in Dar-es-Salaam at 1am from Cameroon where he did duty for the national team in the Chan finals they were knocked out of after losing all their three group matches. Simba announced the arrival of Muduhwa on social media. “Welcome to Msimbazi Master of Defence. Welcome to the big family of national champions defender Peter Muduhwa (Master of Defence). Simba fans welcome you with both hands and we believe you’ll do a great job in the Champions League and Simba Super Cup,” read part of the statement. Muduhwa will play only in the Caf Champions League as he was signed after the closure of the Tanzanian transfer window. Should he impress, Muduhwa could sign a long-term deal with Simba. – @ZililoR
