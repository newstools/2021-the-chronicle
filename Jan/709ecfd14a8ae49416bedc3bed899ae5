UP-AND-COMING RnB songstress Mitchel “Mishy” Ncube who hails from Bulawayo has called on the nation to support her in order for her to realise her dream of reviving the yesteryear genre. For a while now, youngsters pursuing the RnB genre have been overlooked as people seem to prefer genres like Gqom, Zimdancehall and Amapiano. But Mishy, who has joined Helen Nyathi, another fast-rising RnB musician also from Bulawayo, is on a quest to popularise local RnB. Having started singing at the age of 13, Mishy recorded her first professional works last year. She dropped her debut single in November. The 18-year-old artiste who is awaiting her O-level results said she is using this period to pursue her passion in music. “I started singing at the age of 13 and recorded professionally in 2020. My first song titled Ndichifamba which has elements of gospel was released in November last year. “Since then, I’ve not looked back as I dropped Thandolwami on the 10th of January. The track which was produced by TFlaw is about expressing love. Last Sunday, I released Wangitshiya, a track that was produced by Troy Larmain. This is a heartbreak song,” said Mishy. She said she is also working on two more singles, Far Away and Call which should be out in the coming weeks. The teen songwriter revealed plans to work with Nyathi with the hope to revive the long forgotten genre. She encouraged locals to support her music journey as she hopes to make it big locally and penetrate the regional market with time. Other than music, Mishy said she is pursuing a modelling career. “My dream is to become one of the well-known musicians representing Bulawayo and I know that God will help me because He is the one who gave me this voice. “Apart from music, I’m waiting for my O-level results and pursuing modelling though I’m new in this industry as I joined last year in November.” – @mthabisi_mthire.
