THERE could be a delay in the Zimbabwe and Afghanistan cricket series set to take place in Oman next month, but indications are that the tour will go ahead. Zimbabwe Cricket director of cricket Hamilton Masakadza said the dates originally suggested by the Afghanistan Cricket Board were too close to the announcement of a sporting ban in Zimbabwe made by the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC), with the biggest concern being getting local players enough time to prepare for the series. The current sporting suspension means national cricketers can’t fine-tune for the series against Afghanistan. ZC has, however, made an application to the SRC for a special waiver to allow players to start training for the series and to travel to Oman. According to an Afghanistan cricket publication AFG sports, the series is still in line. “A slight delay is on the cards regarding the tour against Zimbabwe, but the tour is very much on. Pinning our hopes alive,” wrote the website. The proposed series consists of two Tests and three Twenty20 Internationals. Afghanistan have opted to hold the series in Oman since the Oman Cricket Academy Ground 1 was confirmed for use as a Test venue by the International Cricket Council. The Afghanistan national cricket team does not play its home matches in Afghanistan due to the ongoing security situation and lack of international standard facilities in the war-torn country. Afghanistan is taking on Ireland in a three-match ODI series this month at the Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. In October last year, the Chevrons travelled for a series against Pakistan and will be hoping the SRC approves its bio-bubble concept to protect the squad from possible Covid-19 infections. The impact of the pandemic has continued into the 2020–21 international calendar. – @innocentskizoe.
