The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Olympic Committee (ZOC) is closely following the Tokyo Olympic Games debate on vaccination of athletes that will compete at the global sports showpiece in six months’ time. The head of France’s Olympic Committee (CNOSF) Denis Masseglia on Wednesday said athletes that want to compete at this year’s Tokyo Games without being vaccinated for Covid-19 will face very tough conditions. More than 15 000 competitors are expected at the Games that are due to start on July 23. Stephen Mudawarima, the ZOC chief executive officer, said they will be guided by the World Health Organisation and the Government. “We will stand guided by WHO, Government of Zimbabwe through the relevant ministries and the IOC (International Olympic Committee). Currently the statement from the IOC as reported is that it will be encouraged, but not mandatory,” said Mudawarima. “As we get closer to the Games, we will get a clearer picture of the vaccination schedules and global  progression on the virus as well. Then we will make an informed decision. In the mean time athletes need to stay safe, train at home if they do not have clearance,” he said. Masseglia said while he understood that Olympic competitors could not jump the vaccine queue, unvaccinated athletes would find things “extremely difficult” in Tokyo. “Between now and the Games, we can think that there is the possibility of having them vaccinated without this penalising other people,” Masseglia told sports daily L’Equipe. He indicated that athletes should face “a form of quarantine” once in Japan and that daily testing might be necessary.
