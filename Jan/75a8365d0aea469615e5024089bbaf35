SIX candidates vying for the three Highlanders executive positions of chairman, secretary-general and committee member have met requirements to contest the elections. Incumbent Kenneth Mhlophe and Johnfat Sibanda are vying for the club’s chairmanship. The secretary-general’s post is being contested by incumbent Israel Moyo and Victoria Falls-based Morgan “Gaza” Dube after club legend Netsai Moyo pulled out of the race before closure of nominations after failing to meet certain requirements. With outgoing committee member Wisdom Mabhena ineligible to contest after serving two consecutive terms, Mgcini Mafu and Bheka Sibanda will lock horns for the position. Highlanders elections had been set for February 7 but the club has been informed by authorities to postpone the process due to Covid-19 restrictions on gatherings. Highlanders board member and returning officer Cosmos Sikhosana said: “The verification process went well; all the six candidates who submitted their nomination forms last Saturday met the requirements. “As for the way forward following latest developments (being denied permission to gather for AGM and elections), the board chairman (Luke Mnkandla) will issue a statement.” To be able to contest, a candidate had to buy nomination form for US$200 and the form had to be signed by at least 10 paid-up Highlanders members. – @ZililoR
