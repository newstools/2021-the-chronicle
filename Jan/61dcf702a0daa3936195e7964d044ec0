The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent UP-AND-COMING songstress, Queen Charlotte (real name Charlotte Isabel Moyo) who hails from Victoria Falls has set her eyes on penetrating the music scene with the release of two singles that will mark her entrance. The 30-year-old RnB and pop musician who once made a stint in the cutthroat industry between 2010 and 2018 in neighbouring South Africa where she was a backup vocalist for Martin Pk, Farlon Lyte and Nigerian singer Prince Okwu said she has been singing since high school. “I’ve been singing since high school, mostly gospel songs at church. I’ve been a leader for several praise and worship teams in South Africa from 2010-2018 under the guidance of gospel moguls Martin Pk and Farlon Lyte. “When I came back to Zimbabwe at the end of 2018, I decided to take my gift to the next level by pursuing music as a solo artiste, focusing on real life inspirational songs. I’m currently being groomed by Trust Samende, a guitarist for Mokoomba.” To mark my entry as a solo artiste, I am working on two singles at one of the Mokoomba studios which will be released later this year. The singles are Ding’imvelaphi yakho, a song which encourages people to know who they are and their roots because sometimes, most of the things one faces in life are linked with our roots. The second track is titled Umendo, a track which basically encourages ladies not to rush into marriage because it’s not a walk in the park. The musician-cum-dancer and influencer is also founder of the Charlotte M Foundation that focuses on helping abused women and children by providing basic needs to improve their lives and emotional support to overcome their situations. – @mthabisi_mthire
