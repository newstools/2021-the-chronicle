The Chronicle ASANTE Kotoko have called foul play after their Caf Champions League clash against Al Hilal of Sudan was called off yesterday afternoon. The two-time Caf Champions League winners were scheduled to play the Sudanese giants yesterday afternoon, but were forced to call the fixture off after several players and officials tested positive for Covid-19 following a bizarre chain of events. Kosta Papic’s side made an official statement three hours before kick-off stating they suspect foul play in the Coronavirus tests that prevented them from adequately preparing for the game. “Four officials and seven players are alleged to have tested positive for Covid-19 after results of the test came in, but were delivered by known officials of Al Hilal. Suspiciously enough, the positive results clearly look different from the negative results,” part of the statement read. Kotoko then alleged the results had been tampered with, but will be able to present a team to honour the fixture, as they looked to overturn the 1-0 deficit from the first-leg for a place in the group stage of Africa’s elite club competition. However, two hours later after ‘waiting for the missing player’s test result’ in order to field a team, the Porcupine Warriors confirmed the game had been called off, as they were unable to field a team before adding they submitted an official petition to Caf over the ‘overwhelming anomalies’ over the Covid-19 testing. — KickOff
