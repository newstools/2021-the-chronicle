ARTISTE Lee McHoney says 2020 was a year in which her acting career blossomed while her music career suffered immensely. The better part of 2020 was a bad one for those in the music industry and performing arts in general due to the Covid-19 pandemic which saw live shows and all arts activities being banned as part of measures to curb the spread of the virus. However, it was also a year of opportunity as Lee McHoney (real name Linda Nyauchi) fell back on an acting career that she has always been passionate about. She played a prominent role as Mai Noku in the hit online drama series, Wadiwa Wepamoyo that was produced by College Central, something she said was great as it brought in revenue. “It’s very important for an artiste to be versatile because you come across a lot of opportunities and grow as a brand that way. Personally, I’ve managed to be active in most areas of the arts industry and this has helped me because when one side is not bringing in revenue, I focus on the other side,” said Lee McHoney. She said her acting career saved her last year. “At the start of last year, I saw my career as an actress grow and that was the best part of my 2020 because I reached places I never imagined. Because of the social media following, I managed to get jobs as an influencer throughout the year and earned enough to take care of myself,” said Lee McHoney. She said last year she could not perform live or even record because of Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions.
“I only performed once during online shows but I did not get paid for it,” said Lee McHoney. She said she is now waiting for the shooting of season two of Wadiwa Wepamoyo which has been delayed by the pandemic. “It’s a bit difficult to plan since the pandemic is still with us. We’re however, scheduled to commence shooting for Wadiwa Wepamoyo season two in March,” she said. – Follow on Twitter @bonganinkunzi.
