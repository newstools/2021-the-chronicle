PRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday expressed shock and grief following the death of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Dr Sibusiso Moyo (SB), describing him as a distinguished scholar whose patience and dignified diplomacy saw the country expanding friendships and registering significant diplomatic gains across the globe. Dr Moyo (59) succumbed to Covid-19 yesterday morning at a local hospital. He became popular because of the role he played during Operation Restore Legacy. Dr Moyo read the November 15, 2017 speech that heralded the new political dispensation in Zimbabwe. He became a household name for displaying unparalleled bravery. In his condolence message, President Mnangagwa said Dr Moyo will be remembered by generations to come for his dedication to his country. “The death early this morning of our Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Major-General (Rtd) Dr SB Moyo, after Covid-19 related complications has come to all of us as a great shock. On behalf of the ruling party, Zanu-PF, Government, my family, on my own and that of our entire nation, I wish to express my sincere and deep heartfelt condolences to the Moyo family,” he said. “My heart goes out especially to his wife, Justice Matanda-Moyo, and to the children on their saddest loss. In condoling with them, I urge them to derive solace and comfort from the distinguished role Dr Moyo played in the service of his people and the nation, for which he shall be remembered and honoured across generations.” President Mnangagwa said the late Dr Moyo whom he appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade in 2017, was determined in executing the Second Republic’s engagement and re-engagement policy through which the country sought to mend relations with the Western countries that imposed illegal sanctions on Zimbabwe. <img class="wp-image-528005 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/SBM1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/SBM1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/SBM1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Dr Sibusiso Moyo (second from right) is assisted to cut a cake by Democratic Republic of Congo Ambassador to Zimbabwe and Dean of Diplomatic Corps Dr Mawampanga Mwana Nanga (third from right) and other invited guests during the 55th Africa Day Celebrations in Harare in July 2018 “In that onerous role, our nation relied on him for a determined execution of our engagement and re-engagement policy through which we sought to embrace the rest of the world, while repairing relations with those countries which had taken positions against us over our legitimate and principled decision to recover our heritage, principally land,” he said. “He persistently deployed patient and dignified diplomacy, even against difficult and often hostile interlocutors. Through that patience and perseverance, Zimbabwe has expanded friendships, and registered significant diplomatic gains and victories across the globe.” The President said Dr Moyo was a distinguished scholar who delicately balanced his time between his responsibilities and chores as a soldier, and his pursuit of higher studies. “Such was his discipline and unrelenting quest for self-improvement which inspired all of us,” he said. Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa described Dr Moyo as a patriot of a rare personal calibre, outstanding military capability and remarkable political acumen. She said Dr Moyo played a central role in the peaceful transfer of power through the November 2017 restoration of the revolution. “His meticulous planning and execution of pertinent events saved the nation from chaos and bloodshed. He would go on to tackle the pariah status of the nation on his appointment as Foreign Minister,” she said. Minister Mutsvangwa said Dr Moyo cultivated a symbiotic relationship with her ministry “as we worked to rebrand the image of the nation.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-528034 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/SBM3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/SBM3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/SBM3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “To both traditional friends and erstwhile adversaries, he was easy to work with because we shared the common bonds as cadres of the national war of liberation! We will forever be indebted to Comrade Dr SB Moyo,” she said. Zanu-PF secretary for information and publicity, Ambassador Simon Khaya Moyo said the nation was robbed of a dedicated veteran of the liberation struggle, a decorated military luminary and an accomplished academic whose service to the country was invaluable. He said Dr Moyo served the country’s pre- and post-independence epoch with distinction. “Indeed, Zimbabwe’s undisputed march towards the attainment of an Upper-Middle Income Economy owes its revitalised momentum to the ingenuity of this illustrious son of the soil. SB as he was affectionately known, was a principled revolutionary, focused, courageous and a forthright character,” said Ambassador Khaya Moyo. “With a heavy heart, the revolutionary party expresses its heartfelt condolences to his dear wife, Justice Mrs Loice Matanda-Moyo and the entire family on the painful loss of a dear husband and father. The family should take solace from the fact that this gigantic loss is not theirs alone, but that of the entire nation.” On his Twitter handle Chief Justice Luke Malaba said Dr Moyo was a true patriot and key pillar in the new dispensation.  “My heartfelt condolences to the family of Cde @MinisterSBMoyo, to His Excellency @edmnangagwa and Government and to the wide Zimbabwean community for the loss of a true patriot and freedom fighter, a key pillar of the new dispensation. RIP SB Moyo, your good works remain with us,” he said. In a Twitter message the Chinese Embassy to Zimbabwe wrote:

Since his appointment in 2017 as Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Minister Moyo has displayed true pan-Africanism in the way he led on several important issues affecting our bilateral relations and the SADC region during the time Zimbabwe was the chair of the SADC Organ for Politics, Defence and Security in 2020. His pan-Africanist views and arguments will always be missed in the multilateral governance organisations of our Continent Africa.” Writing on his official Twitter account, EU Ambassador to Zimbabwe Ambassador Timo Olkkonen also mourned the death of Dr Moyo. “Very sad news indeed about the passing away of @MinisterSBMoyo. Zimbabwe has lost a professional Foreign Minister and a great interlocutor. My sincere condolences go to family, friends and colleagues,” he tweeted.
