The Chronicle Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila players and staff have been summoned into an urgent meeting where they are expected to learn of the club’s sale. Details surrounding the said meeting remain sketchy, however, the crew has it on good authority that the players will learn of the sale of the club, to Brits-based doctor Sello Ntsoko. In a Whatsapp message seen by the Siya crew, the players have been summoned to a meeting with TTM president Lawrence Mulaudzi on Monday. Mulaudzi previously confirmed to the crew that the doctor was keen on purchasing the club when they were still in the GladAfrica Championship, and thereafter attempted to buy a portion of the club’s shares. It is understood that Ntsoko has now succeeded in his quest to purchase the struggling Venda outfit and that a deal for the sale of the club has been reached. This will be the shortest ownership of a topflight club, with Mulaudzi purchasing the status of Bidvest Wits back in June 2020. – Soccer Laduma
