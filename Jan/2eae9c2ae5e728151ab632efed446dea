With the new normal, we want to promote artistes through setting up websites, interactive multimedia development, social media marketing and advanced search engine marketing,” said Ngwenya. He added: “In today’s crowded landscape, a strong brand cuts through noise and clutter and delivers a clear picture of who you are and what you do. 9ninety Sev7en decided to bring this vision into life and tap into the unexploited talent of art from musicians to designers in the city. The main objective of the brand is to bring people together and entertain them, at the same time doing business through the art music industry thus creating a market for designers and musicians,” said Ngwenya. Ngwenya said they are out to give artistes the opportunity to cross pollinate ideas thus leading to the growth of the fashion and music industry in Bulawayo. – @mthabisi_mthire
