IT was all smiles for a Kwekwe man who had both legs amputated due to cancer after he received a wheelchair donation from a well-wisher. Mr Dexter Nyama (54) of Amaveni suburb received another wheelchair last year from the First family after President Mnangagwa and his wife Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa spotted him by the roadside. President Mnangagwa and the First Lady were visiting different towns and cities to assess adherence to lockdown regulations when they met Mr Nyama. Aspiring Kwekwe Member of Parliament, Mr Energy Dhala Ncube on Saturday handed over the wheelchair and groceries to the Nyama family. Handing over the donations, Mr Ncube said society should not wait for the President to assist Mr Nyama. “Mr Nyama cannot wait for His Excellency (President Emerson Mnangagwa) to come and make another donation. We have a responsibility as citizens to assist people living with disabilities like Mr Nyama,” said Mr Ncube. Accepting the donation, Gogo Winnie Nyama, mother to Mr Nyama, thanked Mr Ncube saying the donation had come at a perfect time. “The donation has come at a perfect time when we were just about to run out of ideas. The wheelchair donated by President Mnangagwa broke down as Dexter travels a lot,” said Gogo Nyama. Mr Nyama, a former teacher, lost his first leg in 2002 after he was diagnosed with cancer. Years later doctors recommended that the remaining leg be amputated to save Mr Nyama’s life. Mr Ncube is set to battle it out with Kandros Chikangwe in the Zanu-PF primary elections to elect the party representative for the Kwekwe Central by-elections. The seat fell vacant following the death of Mr Masango Matambanadzo last year.
