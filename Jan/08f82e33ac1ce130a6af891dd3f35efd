The Chronicle Kaizer Chiefs forward Khama Billiat has reacted to the outcome of the Caf Champions League group stage draw held on Friday. Chiefs qualified for their maiden group stage in this season’s Champions League and have been drawn in Group C, alongside Moroccan giants Wydad, Guinea’s Horoya and Angola’s Petro Atletico. They will begin their campaign with a trip to Casablanca on the weekend of 12-14 February, before going back to Luanda in March and finally visiting Conakry in April. Billiat, who is well-versed in travelling the continent both with Zimbabwe and formerly with Mamelodi Sundowns, has assessed the different upcoming encounters and says the team can surprise themselves with how they can go in the competition. “Travelling to Guinea won’t be easy but it takes a lot of determination and sacrifice to travel and win on the road in other parts of the continent,” Billiat told the club’s website. “Horoya run a lot, are very physical and hardworking as a team. They have been in the group stages in three of the last four seasons. We respect that, but they also have weaknesses which can be to our advantage. “Wydad are strong and have been very dominant in recent years. While it won’t be easy, it is possible for us to beat them. We can surprise ourselves as to how far we can go. “With the right mindset, awareness and tactical readiness, we can do well. We need to win our home games and get points on the road and then progress in the competition.”
