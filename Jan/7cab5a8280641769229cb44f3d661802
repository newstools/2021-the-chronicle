BULAWAYO Pool Association (BPA) spokesperson Farai Nyandoro says they’re hopeful of retaining all teams in their league once Covid-19 lockdown restrictions are eased for sport to resume. Just as pool was about to return into full swing, the country was forced into another tightened lockdown following a spike in Covid-19 infections. There are fears that the long period of inactivity could see some pool teams folding. “All our teams have shown willingness to play once the Covid-19 situation has been dealt with. We were hoping things would normalise but that has not been the case. There is not much that can be done and we just have to keep ourselves safe,” said Nyandoro. He said players missed out on a regional tournament that was held in Zambia last week due to Covid-19 restrictions. “It was an opportunity for them to rub shoulders with some of the big name players in Southern Africa. Countries that took part in the tournament include Tanzania, South Africa, Ghana and Botswana,” said Nyandoro.
