The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS legend Netsai “Super” Moyo has reportedly joined the race for the Bosso secretary-general’s position. According to sources, Moyo collected his nomination papers on Thursday. Moyo could neither confirm nor deny that he was in the running for the post and had collected nomination forms, saying he’d respond to questions “later”. “Please call me later in the day,” said Moyo. Moyo, who served as Highlanders’ team manager in 2015, will contest with Victoria Falls-based former Zifa Southern Region vice-chairman Morgan Gaza Dube and incumbent Israel Moyo should he decide to throw his name into the hat. Super Netsai,as he was popularly known in his heydays, was involved in Grassroots Soccer, a non-governmental organisation that uses the power of football to raise awareness on HIV and Aids related issues. Moyo joined Highlanders from the junior ranks and also played for Shu-Shine and Red Seal Rovers. He played alongside other Highlanders greats such as Madinda Ndlovu, the late Willard Mashinkila-Khumalo, Alexander Maseko, Douglas Mloyi, Sidney Zimunya, Rahman Gumbo, the late Titus Majola, the late Mercedes Sibanda and the late Thuthani Moyo. He won the Natbrew Zifa Cup, BAT Rosebowl, Chibuku Trophy and Rothmans Shield with Highlanders in the 1980s. His playing career at Bosso stretched from 1982 to 1995. – @ZililoR
