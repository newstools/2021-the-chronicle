THE African Development Bank (AfDB) says Africa remains a fertile investment ground with much effort premised on the continent’s ability to boost its health sector. Speaking during a United Kingdom Department for International Trade-organised, Africa Investment Conference held virtually last Wednesday,  AfDB president Dr Akinwumi Adesina said: “Africa remains fertile ground for investment, but much hinged on the continent’s ability to boost its healthcare sector.” The one-day event brought together United Kingdom (UK) and African business and government leaders to discuss investment and partnership opportunities. Four sectors namely, sustainable infrastructure, renewable energy, financial and professional services, and agriculture and agri-tech came under the spotlight.-@okazunga
