The Chronicle Manchester United, also know as the Red Devils, is one of the most successful teams in England. They have won more trophies than any other club in English football, including a record 20 league titles and 21 FA Community Shields. Manchester United reached the top of the Premier League table thanks to a deflected volley by Paul Pogba that helped them beat Burnley 1-0 at Turf Moor on Tuesday night. Pogba’s goal came in the 71st minute of the game when teammate Marcus Rashford found him at the edge of the “D” (penalty arc) with an excellent cross from the right. The Frenchman blasted a volley that took a deflection off Burnley defender Matt Lowton to beat Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope. The victory takes United to 36 points from 17 games, three points clear of second place Liverpool. The two sides are set to clash at Anfield on Sunday. United needed only one point at the start of the game to move to the top. This is the first time Manchester United has topped the table at this stage of the season since Sir Alex Ferguson’s title-winning 2012-13 side. After the victory, Manchester United fans were all over the place and expressed their happiness on social media. Top of the league. Already won my day. #ManUtd — Haroon (@HaroonRsheed) January 13, 2021 We the Man United fans right now
