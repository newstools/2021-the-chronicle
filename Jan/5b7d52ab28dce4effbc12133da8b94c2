The Chronicle NEW DELHI- The government yesterday refused to roll back farm reform laws, prompting farmers to threaten to step up their weeks-long protests, but the two sides agreed to meet again on Friday. Tens of thousands of farmers have been camping out on roads around the capital, New Delhi, for 40 days, insisting that the government withdraw the reforms and guarantee a minimum support price for their produce. “I am hopeful the stalemate will be resolved very soon,” Agricultural Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told reporters after the seventh round of meetings between the ministers and 40 farming unions. “For resolution, the cooperation of both sides is essential.” Farmers leaders, however, said they would not give up their fight unless the government agrees to repeal the laws, approved by parliament in September.
