Up-and-coming Afro-pop songstress Lemoniq has collaborated on a new song titled Ngowam’lo with Zimbabwe’s award-winning performing arts ensemble, Umkhathi Theatre Works. The song and its music video (produced by Veins Media) will be released this Friday. The song will be available on Lemoniq’s YouTube channel and other digital stores. The 18-year-old Sizane High School Advanced Level pupil said Ngowam’lo is a song that expresses love and happiness to people. “The song is inspired by love and kindness that has been part of my daily life. The song reminds us to value love,” said Lemoniq, real name Gugulethu Monica Moyo. “I write my own songs and most of them are love songs because my dream is to spread love and happiness. This song is also inspired by the kind of love we find in rural areas.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-525311 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Lemoniq1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Lemoniq1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Lemoniq1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Lemoniq’s first single is a collaboration with multi-award-winning arts ensemble Umkhathi Theatre Works who added their vocal prowess to the song and also featured on the video which was shot at St Peters on the outskirts of Bulawayo. The Emakhandeni-born Lemoniq said she started singing when she was 10 and her mother encouraged her. “My passion for music started when I was 10 and was cultivated by my mother who encouraged me to take it as a career. I chose Afro pop as my genre because I feel that my voice finds its comfort and gets to express what comes from my art,” said Lemoniq. <img class="alignnone wp-image-525313 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Lemoniq2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Lemoniq2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Lemoniq2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Umkhathi Theatre administrator Joseph Ngubo said their collaboration is part of a number of projects they work on with up-and-coming artistes in Bulawayo, as a way of tapping into young audiences in the city and beyond. “As Umkhathi Theatre we work with children and young people in training them and also collaborate with them on various forms of art which include music and dance. This project is also one of those and we shall unleash more projects of this nature,” said Ngubo. <img class="alignnone wp-image-525316 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Lemoniq3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Lemoniq3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Lemoniq3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Umkhathi Theatre Works is a multi- disciplinary performing arts ensemble based in the high-density suburb of Njube in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. — @bonganinkunzi
