The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Acting Business Editor THE Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) has warned the public to be wary of sub-standard fixed installation electric wiring cables that have flooded the market saying use of such cables is hazardous. In a public notice, the energy regulator said it  carried out independent tests on fixed installation wiring cables and established that six companies whose countries of origin is unknown were manufacturing non-compliance cables. The companies are Sunlight BLV, Zambezi, ZunCity, BVR, Mak Cab and Clipszim. “Zera carried out independent tests on fixed installation 1.5mm2 and 2.5mm2 wiring cables on the market, on their compliance to the local cables standards ZWS 240:1999 and ZWS 732:2001. “Zera notes with concern the prevalence of the sub-standard single-core fixed installation wiring cables on the market,” it said. The energy regulator said such cables may create a high risk of fire, damage to the installation and electrocution. “The public is therefore advised to purchase cables that have been found to be compliant and those that bear a standards mark certification such as ZWS/SAZS, SANS,” it said.
