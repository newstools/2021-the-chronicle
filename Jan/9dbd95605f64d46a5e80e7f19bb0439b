THE Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe says Covid-19 induced restrictions are constraining grain movement as millers this year seek to continue importing an estimated 250 000 tonnes of wheat to supplement local production. Following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, countries around the world have promulgated a raft of measures that include national lockdowns, travel restrictions and border closures as part of a broader scope to contain the spread of the disease. Responding to written questions from Business Chronicle yesterday, the Grain Millers Association  of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) chairman Mr Tafadzwa Musarara said the Government has deemed the milling industry an essential service allowing players in the sector to operate 24 hours daily where necessary. “Covid-19 pandemic has triggered a flurry of legislated restrictions both locally and internationally. “Primarily this is affecting our grain importation. “For instance, Botswana government’s tough restrictions have made it impossible to transit maize via Botswana. “This has consequently, seen again congestion at Beitbridge and slowing down of grain imports,” he said. @okazunga
