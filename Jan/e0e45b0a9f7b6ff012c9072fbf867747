BULAWAYO Chiefs FC say they will follow all due processes, as they seek to find common ground with FC Platinum on the saga surrounding forward Perfect Chikwende’s move to Tanzania. The 27-year-old Chikwende bade farewell to the Zvishavane side after signing a two-year deal with Tanzanian champions Simba SC on Friday. However, Chikwende will have to wait a little longer before turning out for Simba after Bulawayo Chiefs halted the process of him getting an international clearance, arguing that FC Platinum should first compensate them since the striker was on loan at the Zimbabwe champions. FC Platinum on the other hand are arguing that they have a two-year contract with the player, placing the two sides at loggerheads. Bulawayo Chiefs communications officer Thulani ‘Javas’ Sibanda said: “Football is a sport governed by statutes and as Bulawayo chiefs, we shall follow the processes and procedures within the statutes, and hopefully find common ground with everyone involved in the transfer of Perfect Chikwende. That being said, we always have good intentions for Perfect and we will continue to wish him well in his endeavours to scale greater heights.” Chikwende caught the eye of the Tanzanians when he played a starring role in FC Platinum’s 1-0 win over Simba SC in the first-leg of the Caf Champions League first round tie at the National Sports Stadium in Harare last month. He scored the match’s solitary goal and was also on target when FC Platinum beat seasoned Caf Champions League campaigners Costa do Sol of Mozambique 2-0 in the second-leg of the preliminary round tie to secure a 4-1 aggregate win for the Zvishavane side in December last year. Simba were determined to get his signature despite interest from two rival Tanzanian clubs. The Zimbabwe champions are believed to have pocketed US$100 000 from the sale of Chikwende. — @innocentskizoe
