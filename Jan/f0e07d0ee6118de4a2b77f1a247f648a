The Chronicle ZIMBABWE Cricket yesterday announced a temporary halt in cricketing activities due to the rising cases of Covid-19 in the country and a new lockdown that has been brought in by the government. In a statement released by Zimbabwe Cricket the country has said that it will try to reschedule all the affected events and fixtures as soon as it is deemed safe to play once again. “This is a very challenging situation, but ZC’s aim is to reschedule all the affected events and fixtures – including the elite men’s domestic T20 competition which was scheduled to begin this Monday – for them to be played as soon as it is deemed safe to do so,” ZC said in a statement. Zimbabwe’s last tour was of Pakistan in November last year where they played 3 ODI and 3 T20Is. They lost the T20I series 3-0 and lost the ODI series 2-1. They were scheduled to host Afghanistan in August 2020, but that series was called off. India, too, were scheduled to visit Zimbabwe in the same month for three ODIs, but that series did not take place due to disruption in cricketing activities. Last month, Zimbabwe were awarded the qualifiers of the 2023 ODI World Cup in a revised scheduled announced by the ICC due to the postponements caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. They will take place between June 18 and July 9 that year. — India Today
