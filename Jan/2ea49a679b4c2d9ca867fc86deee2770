About 15 000 competitors are expected to participate in the Games, scheduled to start on July 23. The Games were postponed last year because of Covid-19 pandemic. ZOC chief executive officer Stephen Mudawarima joined a bandwagon of sports administrators encouraging athletes to stay in shape. “In the mean time athletes need to stay safe and train at home if they do not have clearance,” said Mudawarima. <img class="wp-image-470934 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Tendai-Tagara.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Tendai-Tagara.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Tendai-Tagara-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Naaz president Tendai Tagara Tendai Tagara, National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) president said a fitness programme had been sent to athletes. “Athletes have to be innovative in keeping fit while at the same time not exposing themselves to Covid-19 when training at home.
