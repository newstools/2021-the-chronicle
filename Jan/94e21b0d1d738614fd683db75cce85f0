THREE boys from Tategulu Village under chief Magama in Tsholotsho drowned in Gwayi River while fishing on Wednesday and their bodies were retrieved by the police sub aqua unit the following day. Tobiko Sebele (15), Methembe Dube (14) and his brother Mandlenkosi Dube (12) failed to make it back home after leaving on a fishing expedition. Nqominkosi Ndlovu (17) whom they went with, returned home alone to deliver the bad news. The three boys’ bodies were retrieved yesterday with the help of the sub aqua unit from Bulawayo. It is alleged that Methembe slipped and fell into the river prompting Tobiko to jump into the water body in an attempt to rescue him. After realising that the two were not emerging from the water, Mandlenkosi also jumped in trying to rescue his brother. They all drowned. Nqominkosi returned home and reported the matter to their parents, leading to locals conducting a search to no avail. The police sub aqua unit from Bulawayo was summoned and the bodies were retrieved on Thursday at about 2PM. Matabeleland North police spokesperson inspector Glory Banda confirmed the case. He urged members of the public to ensure that their children adhere to lockdown regulations. Insp Banda also said people must monitor their children, especially juveniles. “We also urge the local authorities to report all cases of drowning in time and to organise themselves and engage the sub aqua unit so that they can be trained how to swim and rescue people,” said Insp Banda. Tsholotsho Rural District chairperson Mr Esau Siwela said there is a gorge at the point the boys wanted to fish from and the part of the river is deep and rocky. Mr Siwela also urged parents to monitor their children’s movements especially during the rainy season. “Children like swimming and now that schools are closed parents should take care of their children,” he said. – @jdgjarachara.
