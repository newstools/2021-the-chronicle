RECENTLY established Ponel Youth Soccer Academy (PYSA) has set its sights on appointing an executive early this year in compliance with Fifa statutes. PYSA founding member Nelson Ndeka said they were of the firm belief that for the academy to fully make an impact, there has to be a well formulated leadership structure to guide the young players. “We cannot underestimate the need for a well co-ordinated executive leadership. The academy has to be aligned to the game’s statutes and that is why we are planning to make sure that all is in place,” Ndeka said. He said the academy was therefore inviting volunteers to take up the posts of chairperson, deputy chairperson, secretary-general, treasurer and committee member. Hwange FC captain Gerald Ndlovu and Sichelesile Ndlovu were appointed brand ambassadors for the academy.
The duo is expected to market the academy’s brand nationaly. The academy, based in Dete, wants to promote, teach and develop the game of football within the Dete community as well as provide quality programmes at the lowest possible cost to participants. PYSA will also promote and encourage the ideas of sportsmanship and principles of fair play among the young players. The academy already has merchandise such as branded face masks and golf t-shirts on sale.
