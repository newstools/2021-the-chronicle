The Chronicle Donald Trump faces trial in the Senate after becoming the first US president to be charged with misconduct in office for a second time. Mr Trump is accused of inciting a mob that stormed Congress last week after he repeated false claims of election fraud. Five people died. The trial will be held after the president leaves office next Wednesday. If Mr Trump is convicted, senators could also vote to bar him from ever holding public office again. The trial follows Wednesday’s vote in the House of Representatives that formally charged — or impeached — the president with “incitement of insurrection” for his role in the riot. The Republican president has rejected responsibility for the violence. In a video released by the White House after the vote, he called on his supporters to remain peaceful, without mentioning his impeachment. The Senate — the upper house of the US Congress — will hold a trial to determine the president’s guilt but this will not happen during Mr Trump’s remaining week in office. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said there was “simply no chance that a fair or serious trial” could conclude given “the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents” that govern trials involving presidents. – BBC news
