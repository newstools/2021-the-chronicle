A 49-year-old man from Epworth in Harare yesterday appeared in court on allegations of sexually abusing a corpse at a funeral. Big Sipiliano of KB169 Jacha in Epworth was facing charges of violating the corpse’s rights and indecent assault when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Babra Mateko. He was freed on $5 000 bail. As part of his bail conditions, he was ordered not to interfere with witnesses and to continue residing at his given address. The matter was remanded to February 8 for routine remand. The court heard that on January 2, the informant was attending a funeral with other neighbours in a room where the body lay in state. It is the State’s case that Sipiliano went on to uncover a white sheet covering the body and said she was still looking beautiful. He allegedly went on top of the corpse and started making some sexually suggestive moves with his clothes on. The court heard that one of the mourners tried to stop Sipiliano from the act to no avail as he threatened to assault her.
