The Chronicle Senegal international Kalidou Koulibaly reportedly wants to join Premier League giants Manchester United. The Red Devils are said to be one of may top European sides who have been keeping an eye on the Napoli star defender over the past couple of years. However, it seems the Manchester outfit could get the man after Spanish publication Marca reported the defender is pushing for a switch to United. While Koulibaly wants the move, Napoli’s asking price of £100million could be the stumbling block for the Red Devils. Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis revealed at the start of the season he was wrong to not to sell Koulibaly when a €110 million offer came in. “By now I have decided one thing: from now on when there are important offers, we will give up, even if they have been here for a year,” De Laurentiis told Radio Kiss Kiss as per TuttoMercato. “In this country (Italy) and in this Europe, I and the fans have to live for the day because that’s what they ask of us. We will do our best working for the day. “When I was offered €110 million, I was wrong not to sell Koulibaly, as did Allan to PSG. He (Allan) was in the January transfer market, I also wanted to protect [former coach Carlo] Ancelotti but PSG had never offered 60 million, I called (PSG president Nasser) Al-Khelaifi and he told me that at the most it would reach €40-€45 million euros.” – KickOff
