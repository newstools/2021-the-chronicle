Bhenasvilla Event Centre (23kms from Bulawayo) because of its scenic natural environment, sounds of singing birds, beautiful green garden and its big chapel. How did you meet?
We met in January, 2016 at a church gathering at Christian Revival Church in Bulawayo. It was love at first sight as I felt she was the one when we exchanged numbers and I asked her out. How did he propose?
My husband proposed on February 1, 2020 at Ster-Kinekor in Bulawayo. I had come down to Zimbabwe from Australia for a two-week visit and on our way to the airport, he suggested that we pass by the cinema. We joined the queue to buy snacks and when I turned around, I found him kneeling down holding a beautiful ring. I froze for a moment then I said yes. <img class="alignnone wp-image-527246 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/wed-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/wed-2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/wed-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> What challenges did you face while preparing for the wedding?
