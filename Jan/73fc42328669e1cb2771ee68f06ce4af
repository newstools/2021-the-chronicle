THE year 2020 was a difficult one for actors and actresses due to the closure of arts spaces with directors however, saying this gave them an opportunity to adapt and look into ways of producing plays that could be consumed by audiences online. This year seems no different as arts spaces have once again been closed as part of measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. National Arts Merit Award-winning Elizabeth Zaza Muchemwa whose play, The Incident won her a gong in 2018, said given the Covid-19 restrictions, directors should come up with interactive plays for online audiences. “We are aware that online productions means that there is no interaction with audience but at the moment we have no option because we do not know when theatres will be opened,” said Muchemwa. She said the prevailing situation calls for a deliberate shift in thinking by theatres practitioners. Muchemwa last year directed a play, Choosing Same through her production company Vaviri Creative that she founded with her sister Makomborero. “We have to start thinking more about what the state of the pandemic means to us and our works and find ways to reach audiences. It’s going to take some time for us to actually have audiences and this could be an opportunity for theatre,” said Muchemwa. Lady Tshawe, who last year won a Roil Bulawayo Arts Award for her play 6.55, said she is working hard on a play that she hopes will appeal to physical and online audiences. “The idea is to get into the rehearsal room between March and April. We don’t know whether to do the play for a physical or virtual audience hence we’re working on both possibilities. I’m working on bettering my directing skills by interacting with other directors from Zimbabwe and outside. “I’m learning how to direct for an online audience,” said Lady Tshawe. – Follow on Twitter @bonganinkunzi.
