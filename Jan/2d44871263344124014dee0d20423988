The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) Bulawayo province says it has been taken aback by the new lockdown restrictions and they now need to come up with new plans on the way forward for the game. Netball had been given the greenlight to resume activities last year, but an increase in Covid-19 cases resulted in sporting activities being halted. “At the moment nothing is happening because of this pandemic. For now, we are still to communicate with clubs, but hoping after this lockdown we need to sit with the clubs and map the way forward. Despite everything that has been happening I still urge all clubs to be penitent; things will be fine,” said Bulawayo provincial chairperson Joseph Nkomazana. Zina had already put in place plans to introduce a Division Two league that will feature teams from around Bulawayo before sporting activities were suspended when the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed. The Division Two league is aimed at accommodating and nurturing players that can’t make it into Division One and Super League teams. Despite plans for the new league being put on hold, the association remains confident that it can still be introduced. – @innocentskizoe
