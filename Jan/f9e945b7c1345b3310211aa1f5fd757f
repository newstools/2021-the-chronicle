The Chronicle Six Nations organisers have confirmed the men’s tournament due to kick off in February remains “as scheduled” after the women’s competition was postponed due to coronavirus. The tournament organisers added the 2021 Women’s Six Nations Championship will be rescheduled for “later this spring or early summer”. The Under-20s Six Nations tournament will also be delayed. In a statement, the Six Nations said: “Six Nations Rugby Limited today confirmed that the Women’s and U20s 2021 Championships will not take place in the regular Six Nations window of February and March this year. “The women’s championship will instead be scheduled in revised windows later this spring or early summer.” The women’s Six Nations is viewed as more challenging to deliver safely and successfully amid the pandemic, given the need for many players to return to their jobs, some of which are key and frontline workers. Meanwhile, France’s government is demanding reassurances on safety from England and Ireland before allowing its national side to visit those countries during the Six Nations next month. The French authorities have concerns over the soaring number of coronavirus cases in the UK and Ireland, and have already barred their clubs from taking part in European competition this month. Italy host France in the opening fixture of the men’s tournament on February 6.
