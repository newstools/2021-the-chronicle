AFRICAN countries including Zimbabwe are about 33 percent ready for a Covid-19 vaccine which is way below the desired 80 percent benchmark. This came out during a World Health Organisation (WHO) briefing where the African regional director Dr Matshidiso Moeti called on governments to engage communities in all Covid-19-related issues for their buy-in. She said Africa was lagging behind and active leadership and engagement from the highest levels of government was needed with solid, comprehensive national coordination plans and systems put in place for the anticipated roll out. Africa has over the past month recorded an increase in Covid-19 cases which has killed an estimated 77 000 people so far and South Africa accounts for more than 36 000 of those. In Zimbabwe, a total of 773 people have succumbed to the virus. <img class="wp-image-527833 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/hotspot.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/hotspot.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/hotspot-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> People boarding a bus to their homes without observing social distancing creating a Covid-19 super spreader spot along Lobengula Street yesterday. — Picture by Dennis Mudzamiri As at January 18, 2021, Zimbabwe had 27 892 confirmed cases, including 17 372 recoveries. Dr Moeti said the WHO analysis of the country readiness data finds only 49 percent have identified the priority populations for vaccination and have plans in place to reach them. <img class="wp-image-527781 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/mats.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/mats.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/mats-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Dr Matshidiso Moeti “Forty countries have updated the tool and provided data to WHO. An analysis finds that based on the self-reports by the countries, the African region has an average score of 33 percent readiness for a Covid-19 vaccine roll-out, which is well below the desired benchmark of 80 percent,” she said. “About 44 percent of our countries have coordination structures in place and only 24 percent have adequate plans for resources and funding while 17 percent have data collection and monitoring tools ready. We also established that just 12 percent have plans to communicate with communities to build trust and drive demand for immunisation,” she added. Dr Moeti added that if communities are not on board and convinced that a vaccine will protect their health, the roll out will be impossible. “It’s critical that countries reach out to communities and hear their concerns and give them a voice in the process,” she said. The organisation estimates the cost of rolling out a Covid-19 vaccine on the African continent to priority populations will be around US$5,7 billion. “This does not include an additional 15-20 percent cost for injection materials and the delivery of vaccines, which require trained health workers, supply chain and logistics and community mobilisation. This cost is based on COVAX facility estimates of the average vaccine price at US$10,55 per dose and that a two-dose regimen will be needed,” she said. Vice President Constantino Chiwenga who is also the Minister of Health and Child Care recently said Government will first ascertain that Covid-19 vaccines are safe before administering them on volunteers. He said he was aware that many Zimbabweans were curious about the Covid-19 vaccine which is being rolled out in other countries and the Ministry was already working on interrogating all safety concerns. “I am also aware that some of our citizens are anxious to get vaccinated. The Government is following the development and dissemination of Covid-19 vaccines by other States, with keen interest. Despite the observations made that other African, European and Asian countries had started rolling out vaccines, Zimbabwe adopted a measured approach, with experts interrogating all safety concerns,” said VP Chiwenga on Friday. — @thamamoe
