TOP Zimbabwe referee Thomas Kusosa has been appointed to officiate at the Total Caf Under-20 Afcon tournament to be held in Mauritania next month. The continental junior football tournament will run from February 14 to March 6. Kusosa, who is going for a second consecutive appointment at the Under-20 continental finals having officiated in the last edition held in Tanzania, is part of 18 assistant referees for the tournament. Zimbabwe soccer referees committee chairman Bryton Malandule welcomed the appointment of Kusosa, saying should he perform well, it will open doors for the country’s officials to be selected for other international assignments. “We are happy as a committee that our referees are getting chances to represent us in such important continental tournaments. It is from these tournaments that referees make it into the Caf Elite A panel that qualifies them for the Afcon main tournament and ultimately the World Cup,” said Malandule. “We know Thomas will represent us well and we wish him well. In refereeing dedication and discipline is very important,” he said. -@ZililoR
