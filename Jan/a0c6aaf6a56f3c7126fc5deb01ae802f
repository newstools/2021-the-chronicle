The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Business Correspondent ZIMBABWE’S largest beverages producer, Delta Corporation has reported an increase in volumes across a number of its segments mostly due to the use of foreign currency introduced at the start of the first lockdown in March last year. In a trading update for the third quarter and nine months to December 31, 2020, the beverages manufacturing company said the stability of the foreign currency auction system and use of foreign currencies for domestic sales under Statutory Instrument 185 of 2020 resulted in stable pricing and consistent product supply due to better access to imported raw materials and spares. “Lager beer volume grew 48 percent  for the quarter and 20 percent for the nine months compared to the same period last year. “The volume recovery is attributed to the competitive pricing and consistent product supply, benefiting from the injection of new returnable glass and fewer disruptions to production operations,” said the company. “In Zimbabwe the Sorghum beer volume grew 29 percent for the quarter but still trailed prior year by 14 percent for the nine months. “There was improved market access following the relaxation of the lockdown measures during the quarter. “The Sorghum Beer category was negatively impacted by limited access to trade channels such as bottle stores and rural markets in the first half of the year.” – @mthabisi_mthire
