THE Bulawayo Progressive Residents Association (BPRA) has called on the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) to fix the roads going to Robert Sinyoka and Mazwi areas near Old Pumula. The poor condition of the roads which have worsened due to heavy rains received this season have made the area inaccessible by vehicles including the Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (Zupco) buses. BPRA Ward 17 chairperson Mr Nqobizitha Moyo said Zupco was no longer carrying passengers going along that route. “We do not blame the bus company for failing to do their duties because if I came across the same situation as them, I would have done the same but we are appealing to the city council to fix the roads in order to make it easy for the Zupco company to ferry the people to and from their respective homes,” posted Mr Moyo on Twitter. Roads in most parts of Bulawayo have developed pot holes posing a risk to motorists and passengers. Council workers resumed work this week after a five-day strike. They are working on clearing backlogs which emanated from the strike and Bulawayo residents hope that the issue of the poor roads will soon be dealt with.
