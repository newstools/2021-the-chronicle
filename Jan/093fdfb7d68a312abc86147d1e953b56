POLICE yesterday warned violators of the 6PM to 6AM curfew, saying that they will be out in full force to ensure full compliance with lockdown regulations. Both defiant motorists and pedestrians risk being arrested and having their vehicles impounded. The curfew was put in place by Government on January 2 as part of a 30-day level four lockdown in order to curb the spread of Covid-19. Under new lockdown measures, church services have been banned, funeral gatherings have been limited to 30 people, bars and bottle stores shut down, restaurants closed while intercity and interprovincial movement has been limited to those classified as essential service providers. Members of the public are expected to shop within a 5 kilometre radius from their homes while essential services employees will be allowed to pass through checkpoints after producing exemption letters. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said those who are found on the wrong side of the law will be swiftly dealt with. “The curfew order runs from 6PM to 6AM the next day. Therefore, movements, whether on foot or motorised are not allowed during this period and anyone found walking or driving will be arrested, with vehicles being impounded. Those travelling between cities should plan their journeys so that they do not breach the curfew order,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. <img class="wp-image-508958 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Assistant-Commissioner-Paul-Nyathi.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Assistant-Commissioner-Paul-Nyathi.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/Assistant-Commissioner-Paul-Nyathi-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi He said as police they noted with concern defiance by some members of the public in terms of compliance with lockdown regulations. “On Sunday, 17th January 2021 and Monday, 18th January 2021, there was chaos along Harare – Bulawayo Road, as long queues stretching from the Norton tollgate up to Whitehouse area, Harare were seen.
