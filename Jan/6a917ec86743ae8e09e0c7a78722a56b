THE Medical and Dental Practitioners Council of Zimbabwe (MDPCZ) has warned members of the public against using unregistered medicines following claims that some drugs have been found to be effective in preventing and treating Covid- 19 related illness. Three drugs namely ivermectin, doxycycline and nano silver have been prescribed for some members of the public and the council has confirmed that it has not registered any drug for the treatment of Covid-19. The MDPCZ is a Statutory Body established In terms of Section 29 of the Health Professions Act (Chapter 27:19). Its functions include regulating the practice of medicine and dentistry in the country by ensuring that every medical and dental practitioner wishing to practise in the country is qualified, registered and is in possession of a valid licence to practice. In a statement yesterday, the MDPCZ said the second wave of Covid-19 had claimed many lives which has led to the stretching of medical and allied services, loss of lives and economic challenges. “There has been widespread advertising on social media by some medical practitioners claiming to be able to treat Covid-19 using lvermectin, Doxycycline and Nano silver. “Various packages have been put out in the media for ‘prevention and treatment and the protocols thereof,’” read the MDPCZ statement. “We would like to set the record straight that Ivermectin is an old drug that is used to treat parasitic infections and is not currently registered by MCAZ for the treatment of Covid -19 patients in Zimbabwe and elsewhere in the world. “There are several ongoing studies looking at the safety and effectiveness of this drug in Covid -19 treatment.” The council said no evidence has come out to warrant its registration and widespread use to treat Covid -19 patients. “Nano Silver is again not registered for use in treating Covid-19. Council has it on record that on August 7, 2020 Alpha Clinic was granted permission to import specified quantities of this drug from South Africa strictly for research purposes and this licence was valid for 2 months,” read the statement. <img class="wp-image-528358 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Nano-silver.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Nano-silver.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Nano-silver-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Nano silver Members of the public were also warned against using veterinary ivermectin in human beings as this pauses great danger to life. “It must be noted that Doxycycline is a restricted prescription drug not to be sold by any person/practitioner. <img class="wp-image-528356 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Doxycycline.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Doxycycline.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Doxycycline-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Doxycycline “There are few proven treatment protocols for Covid- 19 and their indications are clearly spelt out and must be prescribed by registered practitioners,” said MDPCZ. “In as much as the effects of Covid -19 are obvious and worrying to everyone, the safety of the public comes first. “Practitioners are therefore warned against taking advantage of the sick and desperate members of the public during this deadly pandemic. Likewise, the public is urged to be vigilant and watch out against being taken advantage of, and desist from taking the above unsafe treatment.” The council also advised members of the public to contact relevant offices whenever they are offered unsafe treatment by any registered practitioner.
