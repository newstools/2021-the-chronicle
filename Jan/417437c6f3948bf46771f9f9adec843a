The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FOOTBALLERS Union of Zimbabwe (Fuz) has given Bulawayo Chiefs three days to confirm in writing that striker Perfect Chikwende is not their player and Zifa should proceed to grant him an international transfer clearance. Chikwende signed a two-year deal with the Tanzanian league champions last Friday after his sale was hurried through, but has yet to get an international clearance. Chiefs rang Zifa to halt the process of issuing the player with an international clearance, arguing that FC Platinum should give them their share from the deal since Chikwende was on loan at the Zimbabwe champions. He had been loaned to FC Platinum for the 2020 soccer season, but due to the Covid-19 lockdown, Zifa issued guidelines clarifying that contracts that were due to expire in 2020 would rollover into 2021. <img class="wp-image-527562 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Perfect-new.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Perfect-new.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Perfect-new-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Perfect Chikwende In a letter to Chiefs on Wednesday, Fuz president Desmond Maringwa said the Zifa guidelines were not binding. “For the sake of order, the Zifa letter only propose guidelines and the content of such a letter does not constitute binding regulations. Moreover, the Zifa letter even specifically emphasises that “these guidelines are subject to any other mutual agreement or arrangement that parties might have agreed on” hence even Zifa underlines that there must be an agreement between the parties. In the present scenario, there’s no agreement between the parties, since the player is not agreeing to the loan in 2021 and his employment contract has expired,” reads Maringwa’s letter. “Against this background, please note that; “(i) the player doesn’t agree to extend his employment contract by one season “(ii) the player does not agree with a loan in season 2021 to FC Platinum. The player is a free agent and can sign with a new club without any restriction. “We kindly ask you to confirm in writing in the next three days that the player is free from contract with your club and that the club will cooperate with any and all requirements to transfer the player. Please note that should you not cooperate and unduly obstruct or hinder the transfer of the player, the player will not shy away from seeking damages from the club. – @ZililoR
