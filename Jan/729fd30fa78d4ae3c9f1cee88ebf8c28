Mark Geezo said the collection tries to unveil the unique techniques and style that he possesses as seen through a mixture of different genres of reggae, hip hop and soulful. “Nuh know which means, they don’t know, talks about my musical journey and facts that people don’t really know about me. I deny being an upcoming artiste in the song and claim that I have long been in the game (seven years) but had been facing challenges because of my location and origin but however people believe in us as Matabeleland South. “As we approach Valentines I describe traits of stingy men in the track Stingy Men Association. A lot of girls are to be faced with excuses on “let me see what I can do” slogan and this is a song to comfort those ladies,” he said.- @mthabisi_mthire
