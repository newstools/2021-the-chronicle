All is set for the inaugural Midlands Teen Awards (MTAA) where music producer Johnson Brown who has three nominations, will take on President yamaY2K, Tebza and Zvandofarira hit-maker Herman who have two nominations each. A brainchild of 16-year-old Farai Chigumbu, the awards will be held virtually on Saturday. They will be streamed on Earground and Masterminds Media YouTube and Facebook pages. Running under the theme “Culture cannot die”, the awards are being held to appreciate youthful talent in the Midlands province. They are for persons between the ages of 13 and 24 years. “This is a youths’ initiative created to celebrate, promote and recognise creative youths in the Midlands province. The MTAA also seeks to recognise talent in other provinces of Zimbabwe but this will only apply in the special awards category. “These awards are also a way of creating competition among teens who are in the arts industry,” said Chigumbu. He said the idea to host the event was mooted in 2019 but he could not implement it due to lack of funding. “I later approached Masterminds Media and Earground who gladly agreed to help me host the awards,” said Chigumbu. Vetting of nominations was done in December with voting closing last week. Other nominees are Ray Vines, Dillon Mafukidze and TV productions — Wadiwa Wepa Moyo, Indlalifa and Pazimuti. The Ultimate Icon award is set to be conferred to Mariana hit-maker, Nyasha David who is also known as the Advocate of Love (Gweta re Rudo).
