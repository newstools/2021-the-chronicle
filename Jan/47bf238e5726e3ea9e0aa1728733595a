The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent Following in the footsteps of fast-rising Zimdancehall star, Ma9nine, Entumbane’s up-and-coming Zimdancehall musician, Bavada (real name Brendon Mandisodza) successfully launched his EP titled Tsamba on Skyz Metro FM on Friday. The EP produced by Cashlibs City and Givanchy Records both of Harare and also by BmC Studios from Bulawayo, has seven tracks — Tsamba, Usandisiye, Mubvunzo, Mafuro, Kusasa Nyemba featuring Chipman, Nkosi Ulungile featuring Precious Mahachi and Nyongoro. The 24-year-old motor mechanic student at Bulawayo Polytechnic, said as a ghetto boy, his music is about inspiring and giving hope to fellow ghetto youths. “My music is mainly inspired by true life ghetto stories. It contains my thoughts/opinions, what I hear, see and read. In short, I’m a social commentator,” he said. Bavada said resultantly, the EP is focused on his peers. “Tsamba is a big project and a special tribute to all hard working and suffering ghetto youths. I’d like to call it a state of the ghetto address (Soga) because it addresses the daily challenges that we’re facing in the ghetto. “The EP talks about love, peace and happiness as well as things that affect the nation. I love the ghetto, that’s why they call me the ghetto mouthpiece so it’s my duty to make sure that the ghetto youths grievances are heard,” said Bavada. Commenting on the title track, Tsamba, Bavada said: “Tsamba (letter) is a letter to God where I was asking for his intervention. I was asking Him to come and rescue all those youths who are working very hard but aren’t getting rewarded at the end of the day.” Bavada, who has 25 songs to his name, said he released his first single three years ago. – @mthabisi_mthire
