FARMERS have been urged to scout their fields for the fall armyworm and other pests. The fall armyworm has reportedly affected 20 to 30 percent of crops in Matabeleland South, a development that has sent farmers into panic and raised fears that hundreds of hectares of maize could be destroyed if appropriate measures are not taken. While the fall armyworm can damage maize in nearly all stages of the crop’s development, it tends to concentrate on the late-planted crop that would have not yet silked. The pest can only be effectively controlled when the larvae are small, early detection and proper timing of an insecticide application are critical. Zimbabwe Farmers Union executive director Paul Zakariya said the fall armyworm, if not addressed early enough, can significantly reduce yields. Farmers have revealed that if the armyworm spreads throughout the entire country it would affect the 2020/21 cropping season as a large number of crops will be damaged by the pest. “The late planted crop is at greater risk, while the worm is potentially in all provinces, reports have been received of outbreaks in places in Matabeleland South,” said Mr Zakariya. The fall armyworm can be one of the more difficult insect pests to control in field maize. “We continue to advise farmers to relentlessly scout their fields for this and other pests or diseases, early detection may save the day,” he said. He encouraged farmers to seek help from agronomists and extension workers so that they do not lose out on the anticipated 2020/21 cropping season bumper yield.
