A 62-year-old Bulawayo man has been arrested after he was found in possession of a zebra skin and tail. Jabulani Sifelani from Nguboyenja suburb was arrested in North End on Tuesday afternoon following a tip-off from members of the public. Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said residents told the police that they had seen a Zebra skin dumped in a storm water drain along Kirton Road. “We received a tip off from community members to the effect that there has been sighting of zebra skin dumped in a drainage system along Kirton Road and action was taken on the information received,” said Insp Ncube. He said when the police got to the crime scene, the accused was caught red handed and was arrested and taken to ZRP Kumalo where he is detained pending further investigations. Insp Ncube expressed fear that the meat might find its way to local butcheries. “We urge and appeal to all butcheries to be on the lookout for anyone wishing to sell them the meat. Communities are also warned against buying meat from the streets,” he said. Insp Ncube warned members of the public to desist from unauthorised killing of wild animals. “As the police we would like to warn members of the public that only authorised and licensed individuals are permitted by law to be in possession of live wild life or any wild life remains,” he said.
