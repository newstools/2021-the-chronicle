The Chronicle In a joint statement, the Football Association, Premier League, EFL and Women’s Super League said they were confident their tightened coronavirus protocols would enable them to finish the season. The statement read: “Safety is a collective effort and football requires the ongoing support of clubs, managers, players and all those involved in staging matches to continue to manage the spread of infection and set the right example to the public on and off the pitch. “We will offer guidance, education and support as well as reviewing our practices to ensure they remain of the highest standard. Our three organisations have confidence in our Covid-19 protocols and our ability to bring the season to a successful conclusion. “Throughout this crisis, the healthy, safety and well-being off all participants has been our number one priority and by following the national rules and football’s own strict medical and scientific advice, football has been able to maintain its privileged position and continue to engage and entertain millions of people around the country. “The game has a responsibility and during this next critical period it is down to everyone involved to ensure they follow Government rules and our protocols. “We have seen the huge contribution players have made to the national effort and they must continue to use their influence in demonstrating the importance of following the rules. “With full compliance to our Covid-19 protocols — alongside effective testing regimes — we are confident at the halfway point of the season that, with the support of all, the 2020/21 campaign will continues to its conclusion in May. <img class="alignnone wp-image-435555 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/Manchester-United-celebrate-their-early-lead.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/Manchester-United-celebrate-their-early-lead.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/Manchester-United-celebrate-their-early-lead-360x188.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> It comes after a series of urgent meetings between the Premier League, captains and managers to address the new Covid protocols — amid fears that continued non-compliance may trigger government intervention. As Sportsmail revealed last week, a series of stringent measures were sent to clubs in the wake of the new strain of the pandemic. Players were told that they should avoid hugging, high-fives and handshakes, with sanctions promised for breaches. However, top-flight matches since the protocols were sent out have seen repeated instances of group hugs following goals. Sheffield United and both Manchester clubs are among those to have celebrated as normal. Sportsmail revealed that the ongoing situation has prompted worried Premier League officials to take action. They will hold a series of calls with captains, managers and key staff — thought to be safety officers — on Thursday and Friday at 2pm and 4pm. Four summits will be held on each afternoon. On the calls they are expected to be reminded of the new protocols, the reasoning behind them and the potential impact that repeated non-compliance could have. The Premier League say that the talks were planned as part of the rollout of the new protocols. Clubs were informed of the meetings on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said footballers needed to avoid unnecessary forms of physical contact. But the same evening, City’s players celebrated Phil Foden’s winning, first-half goal against Brighton with a nine-man hug.
