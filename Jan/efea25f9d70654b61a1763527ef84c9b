POLICE in Bulawayo have urged women to avoid walking alone in bushy areas even in broad daylight following an increase in cases of rape around the city. This comes after a woman was raped while walking alone in a bushy area between Pumula South and Pumula East on Sunday at around 3PM. These cases could worsen given that many countries including Zimbabwe have imposed lockdowns to fight the spread of Covid-19 which has seen children and women spending more time at home. Provincial police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said the suspected rapist was on the run and appealed to members of the public to help with information that may lead to his arrest. “On 24 January 2021 at around 3PM, the complainant was walking alone where she met the accused person who is unknown, a male adult with dreadlocks. The man grabbed the complainant by the neck, closed her mouth using his hands and dragged her into the bush without saying anything to her,” said Insp Ncube. “After the rape, the accused person fled leaving the complainant lying on the ground.” Insp Ncube said the complainant then got up and proceeded home where she narrated the ordeal to her aunt who then accompanied her to ZRP Pumula and made a report. “Police attended the scene; the accused person was not located and investigations are in progress. Complainant was referred to Mpilo Hospital for medical examination. We appeal to members of the public to avoid using bushy footpaths as they may be at risk of being attacked and raped by criminals,” added Insp Ncube. — @thamamoe
