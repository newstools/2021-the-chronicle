The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo Senior Sports Reporter SPORTS and Recreation Commission acting director-general Sebastian Garikai has said they have not received any application from Highlanders for a waiver to hold their annual general meeting on January 31 and elections on February 7. Last week Highlanders chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube told Chronicle Sport that they had engaged relevant authorities seeking a special waiver to hold their two events. All sporting activities were frozen when the Government imposed a 30-day Level 4 national lockdown to help curb a surge in Covid-19 infections and deaths. Highlanders’ constitution stipulates that the club holds an AGM on the last Sunday of every January. “Highlanders application! We haven’t received it and I even checked with the NSA (National Sports Association). They just need to apply through the NSA or notify the NSA at least,” said Garikai. Zifa communications and competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela also said they have not received any documentation from Highlanders. “Procedurally and in terms of protocol, they apply through us, but as Zifa, we never received any request from Highlanders. We only got one from FC Platinum,” said Gwesela. Highlanders wrote to the Premier Soccer League (PSL) on January 11 asking the league to assist them in securing a waiver from the SRC. Dube expressed surprise when asked about the issue yesterday. PSL chief executive officer Kenny Ndebele could not be reached yesterday to explain whether or not they had forwarded the Bosso letter to Zifa.
