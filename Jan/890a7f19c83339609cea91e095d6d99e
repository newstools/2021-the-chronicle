THE Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) Bulawayo province says its plans are off track as a result of the new lockdown restrictions and they now need to come up with new plans on the way forward for the game. Netball had been given the green light to resume activities last year but an increase in Covid-19 cases resulted in sporting activities being halted. “At the moment nothing is happening because of this pandemic. For now, we are still to communicate with clubs but after this lockdown we need to sit with the clubs and map the way forward,” said Bulawayo provincial chairperson Joseph Nkomazana. Zina had already put in place plans to introduce a Division Two league meant to feature teams from around Bulawayo before sporting activities were suspended as a result of the Covid-19 induced lockdown. The Division Two league is aimed at accommodating and nurturing players that can’t make it into Division One and Super League teams. – @innocentskizoe
