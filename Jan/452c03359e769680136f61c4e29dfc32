THE Covid-19 lockdown has forced many people to innovate and do business online. Social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram are buzzing with entrepreneurs who are finding clients eager to keep in touch with them online. The digital era has led to the rise of new independent business owners operating online. One such entrepreneur, who is cashing in on a suspected baby boom which resulted from the onset of the lockdown in 2020, Ms Zandile Moyo saw an opportunity to venture into selling newborn baby clothes. She says that she is a stay-at-home wife, which makes it easy for her to run her business online and balance with taking care of her family at the same time. “I sell my products in singles and in form of hampers so being home all day gives me time to create the hampers and attend to my customers,’ said Ms Moyo. “Selling online is easy because I can do everything in the comfort of my home. My customers can order online then we set up a collection which everyone is comfortable with and we meet either in the CBD or I do door to door delivery if the customer stays close by.” Ms Moyo says she uses Facebook mostly to advertise her products on groups like the Bulawayo buy and sell, Bulawayo advertisement and Bulawayo business market groups. On WhatsApp she posts on statuses to showcase her items to her customers. “Social media makes selling easy and has a wider coverage and most of all you can easily target your market but the expensive data tariffs do not make operating very easy because not everyone can afford to be online,” says Ms Moyo.
