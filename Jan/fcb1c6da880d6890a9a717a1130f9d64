After many failed attempts to secure a deal outside Zimbabwe, Highlanders and national team defender Peter Muduhwa has finally managed a breakthrough after Simba SC of Tanzania made a six-month loan offer to Bosso that was accepted. The 27-year-old central defensive stalwart, who can also play as a right-back, will join Simba on a six-month loan that may culminate in a permanent move. In an interview from Cameroon where he is participating in the Chan tournament, Muduhwa said: “I’ve heard that something is cooking in the pots with the club and agent working on something. I do not want to jinx it by commenting much and will be happy if the move materialises.” In January 2017, Muduhwa and Prince Dube went for trials at now defunct South African Premier Soccer League club Bidvest Wits, but he failed to make the grade. The defender’s planned move to Sudan last year fell through at the last minute after facilitators were reportedly angered by discovering that he had an agent on the eve of his departure. Muduhwa becomes the first Warriors player at Chan to find a new home after a good performance despite staying a year without playing competitive soccer. – @ZililoR
