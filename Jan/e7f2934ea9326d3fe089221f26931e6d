The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent SOUTH Africa-based up-and-coming Zimbabwean musician, Intercessor (real name Mthandazi Nyathi) has charmed his fans after he joined forces with urban grooves muso Trevor D for a single titled Sobabili. The track that was released this past Saturday is a remix to the original which was part of his 2019 album titled Ngisemathandweni. It is also a follow up to a trap soul jam titled Ng’yakhala which was released last year to tackle the rampant lockdown domestic violence cases. Listening to the track, one is met with a soul diffused sound that rhymes well with the duo’s neat voices and is expected to be a banger as we head to the month of love. <img class="wp-image-527699 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Trevor-21.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Trevor-21.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/Trevor-21-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Trevor D Speaking from his Johannesburg base, Intercessor said: “The song talks about the importance of a girl in my life, making her understand that I can’t spend a day without seeing her. “For the remix, we used Shona, Zulu, Ndebele and English languages.” Hailing from rural Manama in Gwanda, Intercessor said 2021 should be a year of his growth and penetration in big circles. “This is a defining moment for my career. The journey started when I first met the legend Dino Mudondo in town (Jozi) during the period when I was working on my previous album Ngisemathandweni which he featured on. “After working with Dino, I realised that I could now work with any artist that inspired me when growing up so I decided to look for Trevor D because he’s one of the best RnB singers that I grew up listening to,” said Intercessor. – @mthabisi_mthire
