The Chronicle The British Esports Association has partnered with the Coalition of Parents in Esports ©️BEA The British Esports Association has partnered with the Coalition of Parents in Esports (COPE) to spread awareness of esports and promote education on the discipline. COPE was set up by David Herzog, the father of Fortnite professional “Crimz”, and Shae Williams, the mother of “Duster”, a content creator for esports organisation Vanish. It offers advice on player contracts, tax on prize winnings, practice regimes, player well-being and educational and career opportunities. COPE was set up when Williams and Herzog realised there were countless other parents conducting research into esports, so offers a chance for parents to pool knowledge and experiences. The parents also intend to erase negative stigmas attached to competitive gaming and encourage the career opportunities presented to young people by esports. “Like any sport, parental involvement is key to success,” said COPE co-founder and former IBM executive Williams. “We want to encourage parents to get more involved in understanding their child’s passion and helping them get the most out of their esports experiences.” Gamers.
