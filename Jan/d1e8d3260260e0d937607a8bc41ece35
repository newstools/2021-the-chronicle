ZANU-PF has lauded President Mnangagwa for expanding the Agriculture Ministry to Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement by setting up a new department as part of preparing and implementing a Comprehensive National Fisheries Industry Development Plan. The new department, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, will spearhead the development, expansion and necessary regulation of fisheries. It will formulate and implement the Fisheries Research and Development Programme, formulate and enforce laws, rules and regulations governing the management of fisheries among many other functions. The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department will also provide extensive development support services in all aspects of fisheries production, processing and marketing and promoting proper utilisation and conservation of the country’s fisheries and Aquatic resources. In a statement yesterday, Zanu-PF national spokesperson Ambassador Simon Khaya Moyo said the creation of the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources is most timely given the plenty rainfall across the country. “The revolutionary Zanu-PF party applauds the President and First Secretary Cde ED Mnangagwa for expanding the Agriculture Ministry to Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement. The creation of the new department of fisheries and aquatic resources is most timely given the plenty rainfall across the country,” he said. “Fish are key to human life and contribute to the health of the nation’s citizenry. The new department must lead from the front and ensure that all water bodies breed fish to sustain human lives.” Ambassador Moyo said the cost of breeding and harvesting fish must be affordable to all citizens, particularly the poor. <img class="wp-image-442637 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Cde-Simon-Khaya-Moyo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Cde-Simon-Khaya-Moyo.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Cde-Simon-Khaya-Moyo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde Simon Khaya Moyo He said the issue of food production and aggressive fight against Covid-19 pandemic must take centre stage as opposed to engaging in wayward politics. “President ED Mnangagwa has been very eloquent in stating that it is the duty of everyone given the rainy season underway to work hard and ensure that the nation achieves food security, as well as raw materials for our agro industry. Engaging in wayward politics is not a priority, let the people of Zimbabwe unite and focus on food production and wage war against the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Ambassador Khaya Moyo.
