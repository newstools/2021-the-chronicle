THE PPC Zimbabwe Music Awards (PPCZima) 2021 ceremony is going on as planned while the National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) awards ceremony will be shelved and replaced by a legends appreciation ceremony to be held next month. The PPCZima awards submission for entries closed on December 31 last year with organisers highlighting that they are in the process of going through the entries. The adjudication is set to run up to January 13 with the nominees’ announcement slated for January 14. The awards have been slated for February 6. PPCZima chief executive officer Reason Sibanda said preparations for the annual awards which seek to acknowledge and honour musical excellence and creativity are underway and going smoothly. “We’re in the process of vetting the entries to check and edit repeat entries so that we know the exact number of submissions. There is a possibility that we will be reconfiguring the roadmap and the event due to the second wave of lockdown. “I think dates for the awards ceremony should remain the same, but we’re still finalising,” said Sibanda. Meanwhile, the Nama awards have been shelved this year with the event set to make a comeback in 2022 where it will reward performances or artworks from the period December 2019 to November, 2021. Instead of having the Namas, event organisers will virtually honour 40 living arts legends in February. “On the 28th of February 2021, we will host a celebratory Nama which will reward 40 living legends of the industry to commemorate the country’s 40th independence anniversary and NACZ’s 35-year existence. “This will be a virtual event with only a few legends at the venue in line with Covid-19 restrictions,” said National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (Nacz) spokesperson Rodney Ruwende. – @mthabisi_mthire.
