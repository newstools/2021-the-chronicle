FORGOTTEN ex-Highlanders’ star Mubarike “Mamba” Chisoni is on cloud nine after attaining a United States of America Soccer National A Senior Coaching Licence. The US National A Licence course is designed to introduce concepts targeted at coaching players from older juniors to senior level players. The A Licence focuses on recognising principles of the game and technical applications in an 11 vs 11 game format and how these principles influence positional, group and team organisation. The course also examines player, team and game management issues as they relate to senior level players. Candidates were encouraged to understand the four pillars of the game; technical, tactical, psychological and physical, and to devise plans for effectively improving those areas. Chisoni (39), who also holds a US National B Licence and is attached to Bethel University men’s team as assistant coach, vowed to keep on upgrading his knowledge of the game. “Very excited to be done with this one. Thank you to everyone who helped me in this journey. Special thank you to Petty Chisoni for your support and patience. It has been a journey and hope to keep on learning,” he posted on his Facebook timeline. Chisoni left Zimbabwe in 2001 on a football scholarship to the United States and last played for Indiana Invaders in the USL Premier Development League. He was a prolific goal scorer for Coastal Carolina University, where he tallied 27 goals and 24 assists in his three seasons with the institution. Chisoni also played for Cocoa Expos in the USL Premier Development League and spent the 2005 season with Los Angeles Galaxy where he made 11 appearances, playing mostly as a left winger. After being released by Galaxy, Chisoni signed for the Portland Timbers in the USL First Division in 2006.
In 2007 he returned to his first club, Indiana Invaders, to play for their USL Premier Development League team. – @FungaiMuderere
