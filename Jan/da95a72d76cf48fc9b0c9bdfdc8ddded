The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent Hip-hop musicians are expected to meet in Bulawayo, a city touted as the citadel of the genre in Zimbabwe, for a summit where a number of issues affecting the genre and the music industry in general will be discussed. The event which has been named the King City’s Byo Hip Hop Summit, is being organised by Kingcity Media, a grouping of rappers and producers from Bulawayo. It is expected to run under the theme: #For the culture #LevelUp.
The meeting has been set for April 25 and will be held virtually in the event the lockdown regulations will still be in place. Mc Tytoh, one of the organisers said the summit is targeting rappers, producers, DJs, corporate world, budding artistes, video producers and all those who love and appreciate hip-hop. “We’ve set April 25 as the tentative date for the summit. We’re monitoring the Covid-19 situation and regulations on gatherings,” Mc Tytoh said in a statement. He said the city of Bulawayo is befitting to play host to the summit as the city has produced Zimbabwe’s biggest pop and youth culture influencers who include Asaph, the late Cal Vin and Awa Khiwe among others. “The hip-hop fraternity in Bulawayo and by extension Zimbabwe, is experiencing the most exciting times. The genre has produced Bulawayo’s biggest pop and youth culture influencers who include Asaph, the late Cal Vin and Awa. “Artistes from the city have also been dominating radio charts and the recently hosted Zim Hip Hop Awards saw Bulawayo artistes most of the awards,” said Mc Tytoh. He said the summit is not only for Bulawayo artistes as it is open to all. “The summit is not just for Bulawayo but for hip-hop artistes throughout the country. Our objective is to turn singing into business by making the artistes’ brands visible. Focus will also be on understanding the landscape of the local music industry.”
