ARTISTES in Matabeleland South could have handled the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic much better if they had been united in protecting the interests of their trade, a Gwanda based musician has said. In the aftermath of the national lockdown and subsequent ban on gatherings to curb the spread of the pandemic, artistes were left with little to no means of making money from public shows and private performances such as weddings and corporate functions. Gwanda musician Master Zhoe, who released his fifth album in the mining town of Gwanda last month, believes musicians in his home province are failing to realise their full potential because the industry is not united. “We don’t speak with one voice as artistes of Gwanda or Matabeleland South in general because half the time we are pulling in different directions instead of working together as colleagues from the same industry. “We’ve been talking about forming an artistes’ association that will represent our interests for years now, but nothing has come of it because we are not united. “The Covid-19 pandemic hit us hard, especially the artistes who do not have any other means of earning a living outside of music. We could have handled the situation better with an active artistes’ association,” said Master Zhoe. He said the artistes’ association could have canvassed for funds or donations on behalf of members. “Gwanda is a very small town and artistes know each other on a first name basis but we lack a unity of purpose to push our brands forward,” he said. The Gwanda based musician launched his fifth album titled Gwenyambira, that features Nicholas “Madzibaba” Zacharia and Zimdancehall musician Bazooka in November.
