Defiant teachers and parents have been warned against exposing children to Covid-19 through conducting private lessons, as this may lead to the spread of the pandemic. Zimbabwe is presently on Level Four lockdown following a rapid surge in Covid-19 cases across the country, which hit over 1 000 for two days. Deaths are also mounting, making a strong case for citizens to observe the lockdwn measures. But with schools closed to minimise the spread of Covid-19, some teachers are conducting private lessons, so as to make money, but without due regard to the law. Primary and Secondary Education Ministry’s director of communications and advocacy, Mr Taungana Ndoro, yesterday warned teachers and parents against exposing children to the deadly coronavirus. “The ministry’s and Government position is very clear; we don’t allow teachers to conduct extra lessons in facilities that are not designated and lacking standards approved by the Government. We strongly encourage parents not to take their children to these illegal lessons as they risk exposing them to the virus, making it explosive,” he said. Mr Ndoro added that to protect both the children, parents and the whole nation, online and radio lessons were introduced so that children continue to access education. “We urge parents to adopt technology and use online learning materials that are provided. Children can enjoy the lessons from the comfort of their homes and gadgets. “As a ministry, we condemn these teachers offering lessons and parents taking their children there as we are seriously concerned about the standards that these illegal facilities will be lacking including proper monitoring of social distancing, face masking, sanitising and exchange of learning materials including notebooks,” he said.
