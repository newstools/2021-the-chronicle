PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has extended the level IV national Covid-19 lockdown by another two weeks to February 15 at a time when Government is working on the deployment of vaccines. This was announced by Acting President Constantino Chiwenga today in a press briefing in Harare. Acting President Chiwenga, who is also the Minister of Health and Child Care, said the level IV lockdown effected on January 5 has stabilised the situation with the number of infections decreasing substantially. “It is in light of this that His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe and Commander in Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, Dr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa has decided to extend the level IV national lockdown by another two weeks to the 15th of February 2021,” he said “Even though the number of people we are losing to the pandemic are falling, we bemoan the fact that Zimbabweans are dying at home. Any death is one death too.” Acting President Chiwenga said the recovery rate also went up from an all-time low of 54 percent to 75 percent.
