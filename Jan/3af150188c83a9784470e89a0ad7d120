AS the world continues to fight Covid-19, the elderly persons are among the most vulnerable to the pandemic. The virus brings unprecedented fear and uncertainty, especially among senior citizens. Although all age groups are at risk of contracting Covid-19, older people are somewhat more vulnerable and face significant risk of developing severe illness if they contract the disease due to physiological changes that come with ageing and potential underlying health conditions. <img class="alignnone wp-image-529454 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/elderly1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/elderly1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/elderly1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> They have more chronic conditions than younger people, their ageing immune system makes it harder to fight off diseases, infections and viruses. Their recovery rate is usually lower. In Bulawayo, Covid-19 pandemic has worsened the plight of the elderly and amplified their already-existing worries.
Chronicle news crew visited Entembeni Old People’s Home in Luveve suburb and selected elderly persons in the city to share their day-to-day experiences amid the pandemic. Like many people living at the country’s old people’s homes, isolation and gloom punctuate their everyday life. However, their vulnerability and fear of contracting the deadly Covid-19 pandemic was evident in their facial expressions as they shared their stories. Ms Percy Moyo (85) said while they are taught hygienic standards and to adhere to health guidelines, she expressed concern over the loss of social connection. <img class="wp-image-529461 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/elderly2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/elderly2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/elderly2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Percy Moyo “When I arrived here in December last year, it was because I had no one else to look after me following the departure of my daughter to the United Kingdom. I lost three children and I am left with two daughters, one of whom is married,” she said. “I was staying with the one who went to the UK, but she got ill and her daughter came and took her. I was now staying in her house alone until I decided to look for an old people’s home because I value social connection more than anything else.” Ms Moyo said despite finding company at Entembeni Old People’s Home, due to Covid-19, she is now living in fear of contracting and succumbing to the virus due to her vulnerability. “I am pretty much aware of the dangers of contracting Covid-19. Although we are taught to be hygienic and adhere to Covid-19 health guidelines such as social distancing, sanitising and wearing face masks, I still feel chances of contracting the virus are very high since we share bathrooms, bedrooms and dining rooms,” she said. Mr John Ncube (73), a widower, echoed Ms Moyo’s sentiments. He was brought to Entembeni Old Peoples’ Home six months ago. <img class="wp-image-529459 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/elderly4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/elderly4.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/elderly4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> John Ncube “I lost of my wife and four children and the few remaining ones are in South Africa and not looking after me, which is why I am here. Where I used to stay in Nketa, we were always kept indoors and when I came here, we are also not allowed to leave the yard or participate in our routine activities or have visitors,” he said. Mr Ncube said due to his age coupled with underlying conditions, he is now living in fear of contracting the virus. “We are taught to be hygienic and maintain social distancing and each time we use the toilet we are supposed to wash our hands. Everyone here knows that Covid-19 is real and is deadly, but so far here at Entembeni we haven’t encountered any case,” he said. “However, it should be noted that our caregivers are not resident here and therefore it is possible that they might contract the virus elsewhere and infect us and that is my worst fear.” Mr Ncube, a pensioner, said he was forced to approach the Department of Social Welfare after his landlord started demanding rentals in foreign currency, which he could not afford. Established in 1967, Entembeni Old People’s Home is home to 52 elderly people, 39 men and 13 women. The home’s administrator Ms Naome Khumalo said the organisation was facing a number of challenges in terms of funding to cater for their needs and PPEs. “We look after the destitute from the age of 65 and above. In terms of Covid-19 we encourage them to maintain social distancing, regular washing of hands and wearing face masks all the time. We help them understand the need to practice social distancing to keep them safe,” she said. “We know it is tough for the elderly who cherish the time spent with friends and family members, but because of Covid-19, we have been forced to introduce strict measures to protect them from the virus. “We no longer allow visitors to access the home including our donors who are now required to drop their donations and go. Our elderly persons are also not allowed to leave the yard except when there is compelling need.” Ms Khumalo said in the event that one of their elderly persons develop symptoms such as fever with cough, or shortness of breath, they take them to hospital. “Despite the challenges we are facing, we try in whatever possible way to assist them. We have a challenge of sanitisers and facemasks for both the elderly and the staff since we are a non-profit organisation and we rely on donors,” she said. “We are appealing for assistance. We have nurses to look after the elderly and they make sure that the environment is clean and hygiene is our top priority because due to their age they are more vulnerable to Covid-19.” Mr Aaron Mhlanga (85), who lives at his home nearby in Luveve said Covid-19 has created a social disconnect as he now spends most of his time confined at his home with his wife and their 11-year-old granddaughter. <img class="wp-image-529457 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/elderly3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/elderly3.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/elderly3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Aaron Mhlanga “I only go out for routine health check up and medication. Before Covid-19, I used to visit my friends and relatives and they would also visit me, but since the lockdown, we now spend our time at home,” he said. Ms Margaret Velaphi (72) of Lobengula West stays with her 17-year-old granddaughter. Her gate is always kept under lock and key. When Chronicle news crew visited her home, she declined to open the gate and offered to talk to us while we were outside. “Since the outbreak of Covid-19, I have stopped visiting relatives and friends because of the fear of contracting Covid-19, particularly taking into account the fact that we are more vulnerable because of age. I stay with my granddaughter and she is the one who does errands for me,” she said. “My gate is always locked and I don’t entertain visitors because I fear for my life. We are living in unprecedented times and therefore we need to follow the lockdown regulations.” Government recently reviewed the curfew and banned all gatherings, except for funerals, for 30 days as the country intensifies efforts to contain a surge in Covid-19 infections. As was the case during the initial lockdown restrictions in March 2020, only essential services such as hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets will remain open. An expert in social work, Mrs Babongile Mudau-Gora said inadequate testing and access to personal protective equipment and ability to follow preventive measures are challenges faced by institutions taking care of the elderly. “Those with dementia may not remember to wear a mask or maintain social distancing among other adherences to Covid-19 preventive measures. Dealing with the elderly required a specialised skills and patience,” she said. Mrs Mudau-Gora said there is need to ensure that elderly persons are closely monitored. “Practising social distancing is very important, but it somehow becomes difficult for the elders, especially the ones that are living alone. Loneliness among the elderly can often lead to depression and anxiety,” she said. — @mashnets.
