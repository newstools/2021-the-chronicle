African Development Bank (AfDB) president Dr Akinwumi Adesina and 10 African heads of State and government have been honoured for their leadership in the Continental Free Trade Area process. AfCFTA, which is the largest free trade area in the world began trading on January 1, 2021, and is expected to speed up the recovery of the continent and enhance its resilience by increasing the level of intra-African trade in goods and services. In a statement, the regional financial institution said the award was organised by AeTrade Group in collaboration with the African Union (AU) Commission, the African Business Council, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Federation of West African Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and the East African Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture. “AfDB president Dr Adesina and 10 African heads of State and government were on Friday honoured for their leadership in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) process,” it said. Ethiopia former Prime Minister Mr Hailemariam Boshe, at an event held at AU headquarters in Addis Ababa and virtually attended by many other participants was quoted as saying: “As Africans, we are proud of the extraordinary effort made by our leaders towards the success of the AfCFTA.” The awardees included South Africa President and AU chair Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, Democratic Republic of Congo President Mr Felix Tshisekedi who is also the incoming AU chairperson, Egyptian President Mr Ahmed Fattah Al-Sisi, Ghana President Mr Nana Akufo-Addo, and Rwanda President Mr Paul Kagame. <img class="wp-image-493098 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Ramaphosa-announces-national-lockdown.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Ramaphosa-announces-national-lockdown.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/Ramaphosa-announces-national-lockdown-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> President Cyril Ramaphosa Mr Boshe, a patron of the AeTrade Group, hailed the awardees for their strong leadership in the process that led to the AfCFTA coming into force. AU commissioner for trade and industry Ambassador Albert Muchanga noted that the AfCFTA had generated strong support in Africa and the Diaspora, “and we are proud to acknowledge our champions who have been at the forefront of this process.” He took the opportunity to thank the heads of State and governments whose countries have ratified the Free Trade Agreement and invited others to follow suit. “We are also celebrating the key milestones achieved from when we laid the foundation for the initiative to the official start of trading on January 1. “I would like to call on governments and the private sector to take advantage of the opportunities created by the continental initiative to make Africa more prosperous,” he added. AeTrade Group chairman Mr Mulualem Syoum also thanked the AfDB under the leadership of Dr Adesina, for its outstanding technical guidance and financial support to the process. “Moving forward, we want the private sector to speak with one voice. The AfCFTA has shown the way. “To ensure effective implementation, it is time for the private sector to play its role. The Africa that we want can only be achieved through working together,” he said. “We are confident that there is no need for Africa to depend on aid. We can spur domestic mobilisation of resources and synergies.”
