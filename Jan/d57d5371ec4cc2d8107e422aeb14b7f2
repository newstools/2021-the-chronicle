The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Acting Business Editor ZESA Holdings says power generation in the country will be presently limited due to a technical fault at Hwange Thermal Power Station resulting in load curtailment of 200MW during evening peak periods. The plant is Zimbabwe’s largest thermal power station which at present has an installed capacity of 920MW. In 2018, the power company commenced expansion works at Hwange, which when complete the plant will add 600MW into the national grid. In a statement, Zesa advised that restoration of service to optimum levels is underway and urged customers to use electricity sparingly. “ZESA Holdings would like to advise its valued customers countrywide that there is limited power supply in the national grid due to a technical fault at Hwange Power Station. “The technical fault will result in load curtailment of about 200MW during the evening peak period of 1600hrs to 1900hrs,” said the power utility. Zesa said the nation would be updated when the situation improves. Restoration of service to optimum levels is currently underway and customers are advised to use the available power sparingly. Customers will be updated as the situation improves. – @okazunga
