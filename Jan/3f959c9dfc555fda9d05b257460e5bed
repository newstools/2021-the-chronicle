Zvishavane-based outfit FC Platinum are relieved after Government, through the Sports and Recreation Commission, cleared them to resume training in preparation for their Caf Confederation Cup play-offs against Senegalese side ASC Jaraaf next month. The two-legged encounters will see the Zimbabwe champions playing host to the Senegalese at the National Sports Stadium on February 14, with the return leg coming a week later in Dakar. Winning the play-offs will propel Norman Mapeza’s boys to the mini-league phase of the competition. “Yes, we have been cleared to start training and conditions are still the same, bubble concept, testing before and after or in the event of external travel,” said FC Platinum spokesperson Chido Chizondo. Meanwhile, former Dynamos, Maritzburg and Real Kings defender Blessing Moyo and Buildcon’s Donald Teguru have signed for FC Platinum as the miners seek to fortify their squad. FC Platinum are also in advanced talks with former Soccer Star of the Year Rodwell Chinyengetere for a second dance with the club. “He is being assessed. Remember we have up to 40 players we can register, so the coach is working on it and we will know just how far he has gone by end of the week,” said Chizondo. Pure Platinum Play crushed out of the Caf Champions League in a painful way after losing to Tanzaniaan champions Simba SC 1-4 on aggregate followng a slender 1-0 win at home before their world crumbled in the second-leg in Dar es Salaam, losing 0-4.
