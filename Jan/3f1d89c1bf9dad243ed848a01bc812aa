The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter FAST Bowler Blessing Muzarabani won the EspnCricinfo Men’s ODI Bowling Performance of the Year at the EspnCricinfo awards. Muzarabani was the star of the show when the Chevrons pulled off a win in the third and final ODI against Pakistan in Rawalpindi in November last year. Muzarabani picked up five wickets for 49 runs in 10 overs in the third ODI to rake up his best bowling figures in ODIs. The match was tied and went into the Super Over where the tall fast bowler picked up two more wickets to give his batsmen a three-run chase, which they pulled off. According to ESPNcricinfo, there was a change to this year’s adjudication process. “While in previous years a jury of former players, among them Michael Hussey, Daniel Vettori, Daren Ganga, Isa Guha, Ramiz Raja, Daryll Cullinan, Shahriar Nafees, Ajit Agarkar and Mark Nichola,  and ESPNcricinfo editors voted on the best performances in the three men’s international formats, women’s and Associates cricket. This edition of the awards was restricted to elite men’s and women’s cricket, and the jury was picked from ESPNcricinfo’s senior staff.”
