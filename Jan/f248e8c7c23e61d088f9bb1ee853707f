Pishavilla Communication founder Tavaka Matunha said in order to ensure that there is engagement between show producers and audiences, they have introduced a competition for viewers. “We have a segment on our talk show called Show us your talent where we ask viewers to send 30-second video clips of them showcasing their talents. “By so doing, we want to engage with them while encouraging them to stay home, but also show the world what they are good at. With the current lockdown people, are confined to their respective homes thus this platform comes as an instrument of hope as it allows our fellow citizens to remain active and creative while at home,” Matunha said. “We’ve started receiving videos and we’ll start posting them during the week. Due to the lockdown, we’re posting every two weeks our talk show meaning the next episode will be next Friday where Novuyo Seagirl will be the guest artiste,” said Matunha. – @mthabisi_mthire
