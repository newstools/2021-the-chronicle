It was shot at Gwanda’s Spitzkop suburb with some scenes at Njanji Sports bar. “The video showcases Master Zhoe who is lured by a damsel and manages to win her over. Following this success, he confesses his love to her by singing.” The video was shot last year in November during the lockdown with Master Zhoe expressing his gratitude to Njanji owner, Nthuseng Moyo for allowing them to use his premises. “The Ndiwe video will be released on Valentine’s Day as a way of urging men to appreciate and value their loved ones,” said Mora. – @mthabisi_mthire
