The Chronicle A Swiss mediation body says nomadic and farming communities in central Mali have agreed to stop fighting. The Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue said the Fulani and Dogon people signed three peace deals after months of mediation. They agreed to allow the free movement of people and livestock, and to enable all communities to have access to markets in the Koro region. Hundreds of people have been killed in years of clashes over access to land and water. The conflict intensified after jihadists launched an insurgency in the region. â€“ BBC news
