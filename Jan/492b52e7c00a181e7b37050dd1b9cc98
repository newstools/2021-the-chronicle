The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter Germany-based rap queen Awa Khiwe has asked people to pray for her as she is down with pneumonia and from the tone of her message, she seems critical. Sharing the news of her illness with followers on social media this week, Awa wrote: “I have been ill for a week and I’ve been trying to keep it together, but I’m getting worse. It’s not corona, I have pneumonia.” She said she is taking medication and needs to rest as she fights to ensure she does not contract the deadly coronavirus. Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. “I am taking medication and just need to rest and make sure that I don’t catch Covid. The doctor said I might not recover if I catch it because of the lung infection. “Please do not visit me, it’s too risky, let’s love each other from a distance till I have fully recovered.” The artiste who recently announced her return on the music scene with a banger track titled Ngeke Bengimele that is topping charts urged people to pray for her as she is longing to bounce back and continue making music. “I will be back to work mode soon. I am just taking some time off to rest as I am in so much pain. Please keep me in your prayers,” she wrote.
