RECENTLY elected Zimbabwe Volleyball Association president Mxolisi Ndlovu has promised to ensure the game grows in popularity among Zimbabweans while also joining forces with the tourism sector by bidding to host international tournaments. Ndlovu, who has been in the game for many years, was elected the country’s volleyball supremo at the association’s elective congress held in Masvingo early last month, replacing Ringisai Mapondera, who is now secretary-general of the Zone Six region (southern Africa). He beat Tawanda Sithole by 12 votes. Speaking to Chronicle Sport, Ndlovu said he will strive to make sure the fan base is increased through a deliberate and massive recruitment drive which will also see the association increasing its social media presence. “Our main vision is based on national team activity, hosting international tournaments as well as staging many national competitions. As for brand visibility, we shall take a deliberate drive to increase our membership and fan base using all strategies, including social media,” said Ndlovu. He said a number of workshops will be organised for their members to capacitate them and ensure they keep abreast with the latest changes and developments in the game. “We will also endeavour to acquire assets for the organisation for the betterment of the game.” Ndlovu said his executive has since directed all provinces to come up with as many activities, adding that the national association will render all support that might be needed. “All provinces have been directed to have as many activities as possible and we will support such initiatives,” said Ndlovu.
