The Chronicle CAPE TOWN — Chippa United have withdrawn the appointment of Luc Eymael as head coach after widespread criticism on Wednesday. The Port Elizabeth-based club on Wednesday said in a statement that they were partying ways with Lehlohonolo Seema and immediately announced the appointment of Belgian Eymael as his replacement. However, club owner Siviwe Mpengesi was slammed by the Eastern Cape government for the appointment of Eymael, who had been dismissed from his previous job in Tanzania at Young Africans after making racist statements in which he likened the club’s fans to “dogs and monkeys”. “The Eastern Cape provincial government is concerned that Chippa United Football Club have appointed Mr Luc Eymael as their head coach even though they know about the racist and offensive remarks he made about black people supporting his former club,” the provincial government said in a statement released on Thursday. – IOL
