The Chronicle Covid-19 has claimed the life of former Transvaal junior welterweight boxing champion, Ernest “The Duke” Moledi, who died on Wednesday. Moledi, who was born 62 years ago in Meadowlands, Soweto, struggled to breathe before he was rushed to a local hospital,according to the family. “He struggled to breathe on Monday and was rushed to Tshepo Themba Hospital (in Dobsonville) and unfortunately he passed away today,” Moledi’s sister Pauline said. “My brother had a good heart and he did a lot of good things to people and for people. You can write a book about him; we are mourning.” Moledi feared no one in his heyday. His straight-forwardness on matters affecting boxing earned him enemies but this failed to worry him as he believed he was fighting a good fight. Veteran boxing promoter Obed Molekwa — the deputy chairman of the Gauteng Boxing Promoters Association — said the death of Moledi will affect not only his family but also both the people of Meadowlands and the boxing fraternity at large. “He was always helpful and he buried people who struggled financially,” said Molekwa of Soweto Boxing Promotions. Just two weeks ago Moledi buried former pro boxer Jacob Mazibuko, and it was Moledi who helped bury former SA non-white lightweight champion Evans Gwiji in 2016. – Sowetan
