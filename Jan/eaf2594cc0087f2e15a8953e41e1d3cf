The Chronicle A typographical error by the legal team of Ghana’s defeated presidential candidate John Mahama has forced the adjournment of his court case to demand a re-run of last month’s election. Court papers asked for the re-run to be held between Mr Mahama and the election commission — rather than President Nana Akufo-Addo, who was declared the winner of the poll with 51,6 percent of the vote compared with Mr Mahama’s 47,4 percent. <img class="wp-image-526996 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/John-Mahama.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/John-Mahama.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/John-Mahama-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> John Mahama Mr Mahama — a former president — alleged that the election was marred by widespread irregularities. The election commission denies the allegation. The Supreme Court agreed to adjourn the case until Friday so that Mr Mahama’s lawyers can correct the mistake. Both the election commission and Mr Akufo-Addo have dismissed the petition as “incompetent” and “lacking merit”.
Meanwhile, the court ruled in favour of the ex-president’s request to allow proceedings to be broadcast live on television. – BBC news
