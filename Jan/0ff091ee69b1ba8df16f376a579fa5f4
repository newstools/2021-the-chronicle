The Chronicle John Terry questioned whether any team would ever be good enough to beat Chelsea’s unbeaten home record after Liverpool’s Anfield fortress was penetrated by Burnley last night. A late Ashley Barnes penalty helped Sean Dyche’s battle-hardened team emerge with a stunning 1-0 victory which put a major dent in Liverpool’s hopes of retaining their Premier League crown. Just as significantly, it was the first time Jurgen Klopp’s side had been beaten at home in the Premier League since April 2017 when Crystal Palace won on Merseyside, 67 games ago. Terry, meanwhile, was a cornerstone of Jose Mourinho’s relentless machine which went 86 matches unbeaten at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea’s pomp and although he paid tribute to Liverpool’s record, he hinted he believed nobody would ever surpass his old club. He wrote on Instagram: “4 Years Unbeaten At Home Chelsea FC. Some record this is, it’s only when you retire and appreciate how good Liverpool have been to even get close to it. Will This Ever Be Beaten?” – Metro Sport
