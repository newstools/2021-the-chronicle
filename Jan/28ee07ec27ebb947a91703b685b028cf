The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Soccer Coaches Association (Zisca) Bulawayo province secretary Morris Mukwiti says sprawling money games have become a major concern. The long delay in the return of football activities has forced most players allegedly on violate lockdown regulations to take part in money games around the city. Money games in the country as a whole have become even more popular since the national lockdown last year. These used to be popular during pre-season breaks, but they have now become a norm with this Covid-19 crisis that has seen the country going for over a year without football action. A number of players contracted to Division One and Premier Soccer League clubs have found solace in playing money games to keep fit and supplement their earnings, as clubs are also reeling financially since the lockdown begun last year. When the lockdown started, players were involved in hide and seek games with the police, but the games are now being played more openly. Mukwiti feels players have been exposed to behavior inconsistent with professional footballers. “Traditionally money games were considered as challenge games during the off season, but in this Covid-19 situation the games have become rife, and controlling the situation as coaches is an even harder task given we have had no football in a long time. Obviously boredom is creeping into the players, but we advise them not to take risks,” said Mukwiti. “Not only should players be worried about picking up injuries, but football gambling or betting is not healthy for players as it also promotes indiscipline, drugs and violence. Due to the present hardships, where there is no football, players have opted for survival and hardly get income,” he said. PSL chief executive officer Kennedy Ndebele last year issued a stern warning to those breaching set guidelines, saying that players risked being fined for taking part in these games. – @innocentskizoe.
