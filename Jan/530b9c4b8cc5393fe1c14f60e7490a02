Despite rubbing shoulders with Rhumba godfathers — Solomon Skuza and Ndux Malax — Nswabanda has remained obscure and his name will not ring in many Rhumba fans ears. Born Josiah Nkomo in 1966 in Kungubo area, Bulilima District, Nswabanda has been in the music industry for more than 40 years, but success that followed his mentors seems to have deserted him. The older generation from Plumtree, Bulilima and Mangwe Districts will perhaps know him as he was a popular figure in the areas. “I started music as a young boy playing homemade guitars. The first band I was associated with was Solomon Skuza’s in 1979 then Ndux Malax (1991-1995). I left Ndux’s band after his death and the unfortunate part is that I didn’t record with them. <img class="alignnone wp-image-529418 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/mji1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/mji1.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/mji1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I played guitars for Ndux Malax’s B team which was his junior band. I later moved to Mokis Connection band in 1996 where I recorded three songs — Bathethelele, Nduna Malaba and Chelesile. I left the band in 1998 and moved to Soweto, South Africa in 1999 where I then took a break from music to do menial jobs,” Nswabanda said. Besides being associated with greats, Nswabanda says he has been unlucky in the industry as this greatness has not followed him. But now, he believes it is his time. Knowing very well how the industry operates, Nswabanda said he is ready to tackle it as he now has a band, Legends Sounds. “Music needs a lot of capital. I couldn’t get money to have my own band so that affected my career. When we played for Mokis, yes we were popular, but there was no money. It doesn’t matter how talented you are, as long as you don’t have financial support, you won’t go anywhere. “But I believe since they say life begins at 40 and I’ve been in the industry for 40 years, my musical journey is beginning,” he said. <img class="alignnone wp-image-529421 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/mji2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/mji2.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/mji2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Explaining how he got the name Nswabanda, the artiste said: “I got the name Nswabanda when I started playing the guitar as a young boy. During that time, there was a problem of iNswabanda (locusts) so people started calling me that. The name stuck with me and in the music industry, I’m known by that name more than my real name,” he said. His latest album Ngihluphekile which features Kenge has hard-hitting rhumba songs including Chelesile, Ngihluphekile, Bathethelele, Impilo yami, Ngangingazi and Abantwabami by Thobela. “For now, my attention is on making music and taking care of my two children. I got assistance from Cain Leon Ndebele, an airport manager in South Africa who is supporting the band so that I try to earn a living from my talent. I want to assure fans of the rhumba genre that I’ve a lot in store for them.” One thing that makes this musician unique is his permed hair. “This is my style from way back when I started music. One thing I’m particular about is my hair. When going to shows, it’s a must that I get the requisite oils for my hair. I spend a lot on it, that’s how important it is,” Nswabanda said. Ndebele, who is assisting Nswabanda get back on his feet, said he loves music hence his decision to support his countryman. He said he bought instruments for him in order to give him the much needed push. <img class="wp-image-529414 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/cain.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/cain.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/cain-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cain Leon Ndebele “I bought musical instruments and brought in the players led by Nswabanda under the name Josiah Nswabanda Nkomo and Legends Sounds. I take music as a company and the arrangement is that Nswabanda leads the band while I run it,” said the Kungubo-born Ndebele. He said the latest album which is being sold mainly in South Africa is doing very well adding that they managed to get good returns from it. Nswabanda’s four decades in the music industry are visible throughout the album as he brought in all his experience and a mature voice. Throughout the album, one can hear sounds of all the music bands he rubbed shoulders with, but yet feel Nswabanda’s own inimitable sound. — @themkhust
