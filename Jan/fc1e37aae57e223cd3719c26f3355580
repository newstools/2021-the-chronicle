The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma, Showbiz Correspondent BULAWAYO gospel muso Sikhululiwe “Skhu” Sibanda recently released her multilingual second offering titled ‘The coming of the Lord’ as a way to build her fan base. The eight-track album which the artiste sought to use to remind people about the return of Jesus Christ is a follow up to her first offering, ‘A prayer away’ which she recorded in 2018. The tracks which are in Ndebele, English and Xhosa languages are namely Uyeza uyeza, Bazalwane bam, We need you every hour, Bambelela, He lifted me up, Izibela zakho yesu, Indonga, and Umthombo wegazi. “As a musician, I felt compelled to play a part in spreading further, the great works of God. Also, I wanted to grow my brand by singing in a number of languages and this is evidenced in the Xhosa song Izibele zakho.” Bazalwane Bam, Skhu said was a dedication to her father who composed the song when his brother had an accident years back. The musician said she is grateful to fans, artistes and the church community for the support they have been giving her, something that was evidenced by the attendance of her album launch at Harvest House just before the ongoing strict lockdown was imposed. – @mthabisi_mthire
