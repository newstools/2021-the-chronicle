The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter TIME is running out for Zimbabwean striker Perfect Chikwende to be registered for the Caf Champions League by his new club Simba SC as he is still awaiting an international transfer clearance. Chikwende joined the Tanzanian side three weeks ago, but is yet to get his clearance as Bulawayo Chiefs are demanding a share from his sale by FC Platinum. FC Platinum and Chiefs are yet to reach a consensus. Chikwende is hoping the two sides can find each other before the continental club competition window closes this weekend. Chiefs blocked Chikwende from being issued an international transfer clearance demanding that FC Platinum shares the proceeds of his sale. Chiefs and FC Platinum are yet to meet for discussions. -@ZililoR
