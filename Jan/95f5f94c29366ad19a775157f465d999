President Mnangagwa will cut his leave tomorrow to preside over the joint burial of national heroes Cde Moton Malianga and Dr Ellen Gwaradzimba at the National Heroes’ Acre, showing the importance he attaches to the two for the critical roles they played before and after independence. Acting Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Jenfan Muswere confirmed last night that the President “will preside on Thursday”. The burials have to be conducted in line with Covid-19 guidelines, so there can be no body viewing at Stodart Hall and the limited numbers at Heroes’ Acre will need to be masked and spread out. Cde Malianga (91) was a founding nationalist, while Dr Gwaradzimba ended the liberation war as a fighting detachment commander in the south-east before progressing through other work after independence and was Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister at the time of her death. Cde Malianga was a member of Zanu-PF Central Committee who died after a long illness while Dr Gwaradzimba succumbed to Covid-19. <img class="wp-image-527769 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/EllenG.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/EllenG.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/EllenG-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The late Dr Ellen Gwaradzimba The double burial will be the third such ceremony following that of national heroines Cde Victoria Chitepo and Vivian Mwashita in 2016, and Cde George Rutanhire and Cde Maud Muzenda in 2017.
