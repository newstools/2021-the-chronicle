The Chronicle THE Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) introduced the Electronic Cargo Tracking System (ECTS), becoming the fifth revenue administration in Africa to have such an operational Electronic Cargo Tracking and Monitoring System. l The electronic device sealed to the transiting cargo is linked to the control room and reports any violations or any tampering. What should transporters, clearing agents and companies do? Zimra has several geo-fenced transit routes across the country which transporters or clearing agents can choose. Upon processing of Transit Bill of entry at the port of entry, they should indicate and choose their route and this information will be immediately linked to the device and the control room. Once a geo-fenced route has been chosen, transporters should follow it until the truck exists the country.
Offences picked by the ECTS system  The ECTS system has brought efficient clearance processes at the border posts and decongested the points of entry and exit, thus making Zimbabwe a preferred trade and travel corridor in the region.l The system is also a corruption fighting mechanism through embracing modern automation processes, which reduce opportunities for corruption. Covid-19 is real. Always remember to sanitise, wash your hands with water and soap. Stay safe!
